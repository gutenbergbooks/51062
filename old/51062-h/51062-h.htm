<p class="drop-cap">THE author is expected
to say something by
way of introducing, or apologizing
for, his book. What is its object? Why did he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
write it, when there are already so many more than are
wanted? In reply to these questions he would say (what
is evident, indeed, without saying) that nobody adds another
to the long list who does not believe that—on
<i>his</i> subject, at least—there is room for one book more.
And he proves the sincerity of his belief by making the
venture.</p>

<p>The writer of this volume does not claim to present in
it a single new truth. In the sphere of morals, of which
it treats, he believes there is no such thing. It is not new
truths that we need, but the application of old ones to our
daily life and practice. Any device that may assist in securing
so desirable a result is of value; in the hope that
these Fables may not be wholly useless to this end he
hazards their publication. As their title indicates, they will
be found to vary widely in subject and mode of treatment.</p>

<p>One word about the illustrations: these all, without
exception, were drawn for the book. Much time, labor,
and expense have been bestowed upon the effort to make
them appropriate and entertaining. The illustrations of a
story may be compared to the music of a song. We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
bear with some defect in the verse if the music awakens
the sentiment the verse was intended to express. So the
author hopes that the excellence and originality of many
of these designs will in some measure make amends
for whatever deficiencies the reader may discover in
the text.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a
man who kept an inn
on a country road.
Just back of his
house stretched a
dark forest in
which a number
of bad
men lived.
Some of these men
were great fighters,
some were robbers,
some had even murdered
people. And they were all in
the habit of coming to the inn. They
were very glad to have some place
where they could meet together and talk
over the wicked things they had done, and lay
plans for more that they wanted to do.</p>

<p>In that same country, but farther off, there
was a rich plain which was covered with beautiful
farms. The people who lived on these
farms were very different from those who lived in the forest.
They were honest and industrious; they had ministers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
schoolmasters living among them; on every weekday they
might be seen working in their fields, and on every Sunday
going to their churches. And they too used to stop at the
inn as they went to the city to sell the butter, and eggs,
and poultry, they had raised, and to buy the tea, and coffee,
and clothing, and other things, that they needed.</p>

<p>It happened, one day when these good men stopped at
the inn, that the bad men out of the forest were there.
Then the good men went to the landlord, and said:</p>

<p>“Give us a room away from these men where we cannot
hear their evil talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a><br /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="402" height="531" alt="couple walking in woods and a house" />
</div>

<p>So the landlord put them in his parlor on the opposite
side of the house; but though the doors were shut tight,
the noise came through, and was so loud that the men in
the parlor could hardly hear themselves speak. Then they
said to one another:</p>

<p>“What shall we do to get beyond the reach of these
horrid sounds? Truly, we can do nothing else but leave
the place.”</p>

<p>So they went out and harnessed up their horses and
drove off.</p>

<p>The next time they stopped at the inn the bad men were
there again. Then the farm-people called the landlord, and
said to him:</p>

<p>“We want to stay and take dinner here. Bring us
therefore to a room much farther away from these men
than the parlor where you put us before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/illus017.jpg" width="392" height="512" alt="people greeting man at door" />
</div>

<p>So the landlord took them up stairs into the best room
on his second floor, and gave them the key of the door,
that they might lock themselves in and stay as long as
they wanted. But the bad men had seen them going up,
and presently they seized the great clubs that they always
carried, and hurried up after them.</p>

<p>“Let us in!” they cried.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="398" height="546" alt="two men talking to man in doorway inset of people running upstairs background of birds flying in wind" />
</div>

<p>But without waiting for any answer they broke down
the door and rushed at the men who were sitting around
the table, until they had to run for their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, after everybody had gone to bed and the
landlord had locked up the inn, as he sat alone by the fire,
he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I must do one thing or the other. I must turn away
either the good men or the bad men, for it is plain they
cannot both come to my house. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p>After thinking a while longer he said:</p>

<p>“I admit that the people from the forest buy a good deal
more out of my bar-room—wine, brandy, and whiskey—but
then they get drunk and break my furniture, and often
refuse to pay for what they have had; so that, in truth, I
do not make any great profit out of them, after all—not
near enough to make up for the bad example they set my
children and the bad name they give my house. But the
people from the farms, though they do not buy any brandy,
or whiskey, buy a good deal more of bread and meat, and
they always pay for what they get. By the end of the
year I am sure that I make more out of them than I do out
of the others. Then they are kind to my family, and they
make my house respectable and give it a good name. I am
resolved what to do, and which to turn away. These shall
stay, and the others shall go; and to-morrow I will tell
them.”</p>

<p>So, after making up his mind, he went to bed and slept
all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/illus021.jpg" width="396" height="530" alt="Inn with words above: Out of the Heart are the Issues of Life" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Early the next morning he opened his house. As soon
as the door was unlocked in came the men from the forest,
and they kept on coming till the bar-room was full. Then,
while they were making a great noise, talking very loud,
and calling for drink, the landlord rapped on the top of
the bar and cried:</p>

<p>“Silence, and listen to me! You men have been coming
here and doing as you pleased, until you seem to think
the house belongs to you, and that you can turn people out
of it whenever you like. But I am the one who has to pay
the rent, and I think it is for me to say who shall come and
who shall go. And now I say that I want you to go and
never come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="403" height="518" alt="man at bar talking to group of men; inset of man sitting alone by fire" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the landlord had spoken in this firm way
the men out of the forest—who, in spite of their boasting,
were great cowards—began to steal off one by one, until
they were all gone; at which the landlord was glad, for he
thought he had gotten rid of them altogether. But in this
he was mistaken, for in a few days they were back again,
standing about the doors and watching for a chance to
get in.</p>

<p>To keep them out the landlord shut up all but the front
door, and tried to keep his eye on that. But so impudent
had the men grown that they began to climb into the windows
when no one was looking. Then the landlord sent
for the blacksmith and had iron bars put across every
window. But after he had done this the men even got
up on the roof in some way, and came down the chimney
like so many sweeps; at which the landlord told his hired
man to build a hot fire, and to keep it blazing no matter
how much wood it burned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/illus025.jpg" width="388" height="509" alt="men trying to get in" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not possible to close every door, and window,
and chimney, and keep them always shut. There
was the side door, that opened into the flower-garden,
where sometimes persons wanted to walk; and there was
the back door, out of which the cook must go to the
woodpile many times every day. Some of the windows
opened on beautiful prospects, where the boarders liked
to sit and look out. So that, do what he would, the
landlord often found places left open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And, beside this, the men out of the forest had lately
changed their plan. They came now dressed up like the
farm-people, and sometimes the landlord could hardly tell
one from the other. In short, they were too clever for
him; and so, in spite of
all he could do, they got
in, and every day he
would meet some of them
sneaking about the house,
or hidden in some closet
or corner, or under a
bed.</p>

</div>


<p>While things were in
this sad state he was sitting
one night before the
fire by himself, just as he sat on the night that he made up
his mind to order the bad men out of his house. But how
differently he felt now from what he felt then! Then he
thought he could have everything his own way, but now
he had done his utmost, and, instead of getting better,
things were getting worse and worse. He was very much
discouraged and low-spirited.</p>

<p>Then he began to think of some of the wrong things
that he had done himself. He had been too friendly with
these bad men, and not as kind as he should have been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
some good men that he knew. Especially he remembered
how unkindly he had treated one good man. It happened
in this way.</p>

<p>When he first came to the inn, after renting it, he found
a watchman there. The owner of the inn had sent him to
watch it, and keep it safe. When the landlord came, this
watchman did not go away, but stayed on. The owner had
told him to stay and watch the house; for, although the
owner had rented it, the house still belonged to him.</p>

<p>So the watchman stayed and tried to make himself useful
to the landlord. But the landlord paid no attention to
him; in truth, he often treated him rudely, until one day,
when the watchman was warning him against these very
men out of the forest, the landlord told him he could take
care of his house himself, and that he did not want his help
any further.</p>

<p>Since that time the poor man had been staying about
the inn wherever he could find a place. Sometimes he
slept down in the cellar, sometimes out in the wood-house;
and when he got anything to eat, it was always
after the servants were done, and only such food as was
left from their table. And now the landlord remembered
all this. While he sat thinking about it before the fire,
there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the landlord; and the door opened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in walked this same watchman. He did not say a word,
but stood still, looking right at the landlord.</p>

<p>“Watchman,” said the landlord, “I have treated you
very unkindly, and I am sorry for it. Are you willing to
forgive me and be watchman again?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said the watchman, “if you will promise to pay
attention when I warn you of danger.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said the landlord; “I will do anything to
get out of the trouble I am in.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” replied the watchman; “it is a bargain
between us. But now go to bed and get some rest,
for you need it.”</p>

<p>So the landlord went to bed, and because his worry of
mind had worn him down a good deal he soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, before any one else was awake,
the watchman was up and at work. The first thing he did
was to build up the little room, or watch-box, that used to
stand in front of the house. It was placed there on purpose
for him when the house was first built, but because it
had not been taken care of it had long since tumbled down.
But now the watchman built it up again, setting in windows
all around it, so that as he stood there, he could look out
on every side. As soon as he had built up his watch-box
he fixed the cord, or bell-rope, that reached from there
into the landlord’s chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/illus031.jpg" width="389" height="534" alt="older man sitting by fire, man in uniform standing beside him; inset of man in uniform knocking on door" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>And no sooner was this done than, seeing one of the
forest-people coming toward the house, he pulled the cord
and rang the bell. At this the landlord awoke. He knew
what it meant. He did not need any one to tell him, for he
used to hear that bell long ago, although he then paid no
attention to it. But now he jumped up and dressed
quickly, and ran to the door just in time to shut out one
of the very worst of the men from the forest.</p>

<p>After that the bell went on ringing every day, and the
landlord was kept busy shutting doors and windows. It
must be confessed that he got tired of hearing it sometimes;
but he was so much happier, he ate so much
better and slept so much sounder than he did before,
that, even when it put him to a good deal of trouble, he
was always careful to obey the bell.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="399" height="525" alt="Life time scenes" />
</div>

<p>All this time the good farm-people were made welcome
at the inn. The door was always wide open to them, and
the best of food was put on their table. As they never
went into the bar-room to buy anything to drink, and as
they disliked very much to see drunkards about, the landlord
concluded to take away his bar and make the inn a
temperance house. Being pleased at this, the farm-people
came oftener and stayed longer than ever before, until the
landlord found himself growing rich on the money they
paid him. Then he painted his house inside and out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
added some new rooms to it, and made it more comfortable
every year.</p>

<p>When the forest-people found that the watchman was
always looking out for them, and that the landlord always
paid attention to his bell—and when they saw, too, that the
company in the house was such as would make them feel
ashamed, even if they should get in there—they did not
try to get in as often as they used, and so the bell did
not ring nearly so often. Then the landlord had time to
walk in his garden and to sit down in the shade of his
favorite tree, which he had not been able to do for long
years before.</p>

<p>And so things went on from year to year. The landlord
never ceased to mind the bell, and gradually, as he grew
older, it rang more and more seldom, until, during his last
sickness, while he was shut up in his chamber, growing
weaker and weaker every day, it stopped ringing altogether.
And this was not because the watchman (whose name was
Conscience) was unwilling to disturb him, but because the
forest-people (that is, wicked thoughts and bad desires) did
not trouble him any further.</p>

<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="398" height="542" alt="two young people crying about old man in bed; inset two children sitting outside" />
</div>

<p>So the old man lay in peace and quietness until he died.
Then his son took the inn and carried it on. It is true that
the men out of the forest knew as soon as the old man was
dead, and thinking that now, as there was a new master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
they might perhaps be able to get in, they came and tried
again and again. And the son had to fight his own battles
with them like his father. But he kept the watchman in
his house, and minded the bell; and in the end he gained
the victory, as his father had done before him.</p>

<h2>THE BROOK AND THE WATER-WHEEL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE water-wheel in a grist-mill went round and round,
by day and by night, without stopping. Said the
brook one day, as it passed over the wheel:</p>

<p>“Are you not tired of being always at work, and of
doing the same thing to-day that you did yesterday?
When I have done my work in making you turn, I glide
on and take my pleasure in flowing through the fields
and the woods.”</p>

<p>“But my pleasure,” replied the wheel, “is in continuing
to work, and go round and round, grinding up the corn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yesterday,” continued the brook, “as I flowed through
the meadow, I heard some people who were wandering
there say how beautiful I was, and what sweet music I
made as I rippled over the stones.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt they said what was true,” replied the
wheel, “but it could never be said of me. How would I
look rolling through the meadow? I would not be admired
by others, nor would I enjoy it myself.”</p>

<p>“You are to be admired for your humility,” said the
brook, “in being contented with so dismal a place.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied the wheel, “for when this place
was given me, I was given also a liking for it.”</p>

<p>“But do you not long for the sunlight and the breeze
and a sight of the birds and the flowers?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus039.jpg" width="520" height="576" alt="Different mill" />
</div>

<p>“No more than you do for this dim chamber under the
mill. Here I was made to dwell, and here I am satisfied to
be. I greet you tumbling in from the mountain-side over
my head, and I bid you adieu as you flow out joyously
under my feet; but I do not long to follow you. The
summer’s heat does not parch me here, nor the winter’s
frost stop me from turning. Ever in this dim twilight I
revolve and listen to the sound of the grinding. I delight
to hear the farmer drive his team to the mill door loaded
with grain, and afterward haul it away when I have made
it into flour for his wife and children to eat. I am content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to stay here and labor—not by constraint nor for duty’s
sake alone, but because the place accords with my nature,
and therefore it is my choice.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">We often err in judging the lot of others by our own
feelings and preferences, forgetting that, from differences
in taste or training, what would be pain to us may be
pleasure to them.</p>

<h2>THE COURT-HOUSE STEEPLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE steeple on a country court-house was built to
hold a clock. But when a year or more had passed
after it was finished, and no clock appeared, it began to
complain that the promise made to it had not been
kept.</p>

<p>“I expected to be of some consequence in the village,”
it said, “but with these ugly round holes in my side left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
boarded up, I am of no more account than if I did not
exist.”</p>

<p>The town council, having heard of what it said, met
together to talk over the matter, when they had to admit
that the complaint was just; so an extra effort was made
to raise the money needed, and, this being successful, the
clock was ordered, and in due time put in its place.</p>

<p>And now the steeple’s ambition was fully gratified.
The clock kept good time and was the standard for the
whole village. The farmers went to their work by it, and
the children to school; the people also who drove in from
the country might be seen, as they passed the court-house,
leaning forward, with upturned faces, to get the correct
hour.</p>

<p>Week after week passed, and month after month, and
still the steeple was gazed at by old and young a hundred
times a day. But after a good many months had rolled
round, notwithstanding all this attention, it began to be
conscious of a change within itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/illus043.jpg" width="507" height="651" alt="man inside clockworks" />
</div>

<p>“It is true I have got what I asked for,” it said, “and
my proudest wishes have been fulfilled; but, after all, what
have I gained by it or how am I any better off? I am just
as much exposed to the winter’s cold and the summer’s
heat, to the risk of storm and lightning and fire, as ever.
And, as for being looked at—which I once thought so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
much of—I’m tired of it, and could wish myself back to
what I was before, instead of being forced to listen to the
click of these wheels and the banging of that great iron
hammer by night and by day. I believe I’d rather be the
empty steeple on the church, across the street.”</p>

<p>At length its complainings reached the ears of one of
the council, who, though an old man, climbed up the
steeple’s winding stair and listened patiently to what it
had to say. When it had finished, he answered:</p>

<p>“My friend, I think I can put my finger on the cause
of your discontent. You were very anxious to have the
clock, you remember, but perhaps you never recognized
the reason, which was only a desire to increase your own
importance. You thought that all the watches and all the
little clocks in town would be regulated and ruled over by
you. Your motive was wholly selfish, and, as a consequence,
when you got what you wanted, it failed to
satisfy.</p>

<p>“Now, as for taking the clock down again, that is out
of the question. It was put here for the benefit of all, and
here it must stay. Nevertheless, if you will take an old
man’s advice, I think your troubles will soon come to an
end. Instead of thinking only of yourself, your own comfort,
and your own consequence, think of other people.
Remember the good you have the power to do them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for their sakes be willing to do it. Then you will find that
the possessions which yield no satisfaction while hoarded up
only for self, impart a real joy when shared with others in
the uses of charity.”</p>

<h2>CROOKED HORN AND OLD BRINDLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp; COW that had a crooked horn learned to open gates
and let down bars with it, and, as her master took no
pains to keep her at home, she roamed the roads unrestrained.
One day, in passing a neighbor’s meadow, she
saw an old brindled cow inside hobbled by a rope and
clog of wood fastened to one leg.</p>

<p>“Who put that on you?” asked Crooked Horn.</p>

<p>“My master,” replied Brindle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To keep me from jumping fences.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he’s not my master. Why don’t you leave
him and take to the woods?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s kind to me in other ways. He gives me
a warm bed, and plenty to eat, in the winter, and beside,
I have a notion that I’ve got myself to blame.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’m allowed to jump all the fences I like.
Whenever I see a good dinner through the bars, over I go,
no matter whom it belongs to.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could do so,” said Brindle.</p>

<p>“But you can’t,” cried Crooked Horn. “I’m on

away. But just as she reached the track an express train
dashed past, and old Brindle saw the engine toss her boastful
acquaintance into the air as a mad bull tosses a dog.
Another moment, and poor Crooked Horn lay in the ditch
mangled and dead.</p>

<h2>THE MILLER’S TENTH.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp; YOUNG miller who had succeeded to his father’s
business, made flour for the people of his native
village, and also for the farmers of the country around,
receiving for his pay, or toll, one-tenth of the grain that
he ground. He measured this out in a round box—called
a “toll-dish”—which contained just one-tenth of a bushel.</p>

<p>Among his customers was an old farmer who, having
his farm all paid for and well stocked, with some money
out at interest beside, was looked upon by his neighbors as
a rich man. He used to come about once a fortnight to
the mill, bringing four or five bags of wheat to be
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, after the old man had left, as the miller began
pouring his wheat into the hopper, the thought occurred to
him that if he should take a little more than a tenth the
farmer would never miss it.</p>

<p>“Other millers do it,” said he, “and so might I as
well. Beside, I will make it up to him by extra care in
grinding his flour.”</p>

<p>So, after he had taken out the tenth that he was entitled
to, he filled the toll-dish twice again and emptied the contents
into a barrel of his own wheat that stood near.</p>

<p>But the miller did not feel altogether satisfied with what
he had done. The thought of it disquieted him more than
once. Yet he could not quite persuade himself to put
the wheat back.</p>

<p>“I think I’m fairly entitled to something more,” he
said, “from such a rich man.”</p>

<p>Then a bright thought struck him. There was in the
mill some corn that belonged to a widow. She had
wheeled it there in a barrow—poor woman!—with her
own hands, and left it to be ground into meal.</p>

<p>“I’ll take something less than my full toll from her,” he
said, “and so will make matters square by remembering the
poor.”</p>

<p>This seemed for a time to overcome his scruples, and,
having made a beginning, he gradually increased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a><br /><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
extra toll that he took from the rich farmer, but soon
discontinued making any allowance on his poor customer’s
grist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">
<img src="images/illus053.jpg" width="515" height="664" alt="miller working" />
</div>

<p>But, though the miller had made a correct calculation
concerning the farmer—viz., that he would not miss what
was unjustly taken from him—he had made a wrong
estimate of his own conscience. He found by thus testing
it that it was not of the sort to heal while he kept
on wounding it afresh, or to accept as true what he knew
to be false. It was rather of the kind that we find it
so inconvenient to have when we want to do wrong and
still be as comfortable as if we were doing right.</p>

<p>The miller was in the habit of going to the village
church on a Sunday, where he sat in the pew with his
wife and little children, taking part in the service and listening
to the minister’s sermon. But now, whenever the
eighth commandment was repeated, or so much as alluded
to, he grew restless and uneasy and anxious for the service
to be over.</p>

<p>On week-days the stage-driver, as he passed the mill
door, threw out a newspaper that the miller subscribed
for, and it had long been his favorite pastime, as the
great water-wheel was revolving and the millstones
were grinding, to sit among the bags of grain in his flour-besprinkled
clothes and read his paper through and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
through. But of late he found himself avoiding all
paragraphs headed: “<span class="smcap">Defalcation</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Embezzlement</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Breach of Trust</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Conscience Fund</span>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="517" height="667" alt="people in church" />
</div>

<p>Now and then he stumbled on an account that was published
there of some honest debtor who as soon as he was
able paid up his back debts, or of some repentant thief
who made restitution of the things he had stolen. This
was unpleasant reading to the miller.</p>

<p>In the village there lived a man who had done just the
reverse of these things, and in consequence bore a bad
name. The miller disliked to meet this man. Occasionally
he had to go on business to the county-town, and on
his way passed the jail. Peering through the bars he
often saw the evil countenances of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“What are they in there for, I wonder?” he said
to himself. “The truth is I deserve to be there with
them.”</p>

<p>And this finding of a rebuke in whatever he came
across went on until everything about him seemed to join
in a dreadful chorus, accusing him of his crime.</p>

<p>But at last the load on his conscience became too
heavy, and he could bear it no longer. But what should
he do to get rid of it? To confess his guilt would crush
him to the earth. There was but one thing more dreadful,
and that was to go on hiding it. But was there no way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
escaping an open confession? Ah! happy thought! This
would not be necessary. The farmer was still confidingly
bringing his grain every two weeks to the mill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/illus057.jpg" width="517" height="665" alt="Miller driving cart past jail" />
</div>

<p>“I will go over my accounts,” said the miller, “and
add up to the last pound all I have ever taken from him,
and this I will return gradually, from time to time, with
his flour, in quantities that will not be noticed; so I shall
pay my debt and clear my conscience without being even
suspected of wrong.”</p>

<p>Having made this resolve, he longed to put it in
practice, and could hardly wait for the next appearance
of the farmer’s wagon. In a few days, however, it drove
up to the mill door as usual. The miller with a glad
heart (which he was careful to conceal) carried the bags
it was loaded with into the mill, and bade the farmer a
cheerful “Good-bye” as he drove away.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “I will take out of this grinding a
part of my toll, lest, if I should take none, the difference
may be noticed and some inquiry made.”</p>

<p>So he filled the toll-dish three times instead of six,
as he was entitled to, and ground up the rest of the
wheat.</p>

<p>But while he was thus carrying out, in secret, his plan
at the mill, he little suspected how matters stood at the
farmhouse. The farmer’s wife, who was a more shrewd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a><br /><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
observer than himself in such things as came directly
under her charge, had noticed for some time past that the
returns from the mill seemed short in weight, and at length
she confided her suspicions to her husband.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">
<img src="images/illus059.jpg" width="523" height="674" alt="flour brought back to farmer" />
</div>

<p>“Nonsense!” said he. “I’ve known the miller all his
life, and his father before him: his father had a conscience,
and so has he.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied his wife, “there’s one way of testing it
that neither you nor anybody else can object to. I weighed
what we last sent him; now we’ll weigh what he sends back
to us.”</p>

<p>As the farmer could find no fault with this proposal, he
called it a bargain, and the next day went to the mill for
the grinding. The miller received him gladly and hastened
to carry out his grist to the wagon. As he drove homeward
the farmer said to himself:</p>

<p>“How strange that wife should speak so about the
flour! But women do sometimes take up such queer
notions. I’ll be bound, now, that she will be waiting,
when I get home, to have the bags put on the scales as
soon as they are unloaded.”</p>

<p>He was not wrong. As he drove through the gate
around to the side porch his wife appeared in her great
white apron, hardly able to keep quiet until the wagon
was backed up, and as the bags were taken out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
it they were laid, one by one, on the scales that stood
near.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="520" height="671" alt="farmer and wife weighing bags" />
</div>

<p>“How does it come out, wife?” cried the farmer as she
set down the pounds contained in the last bag.</p>

<p>But she kept on going over the figures again and again
without answering, at which the old man put on his spectacles
and hastily footed them up.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you so?” he exclaimed, with a reproachful
look for her and a triumphant one for himself. “Why,
instead of cheating us, he has cheated himself! What
a pity it is for a woman to be suspicious!”</p>

<p>“Don’t brag too soon,” said his wife, piqued at his
words; “you’d better put that off till we’ve weighed
another grinding.”</p>

<p>The hungry mouths on the farm soon demanded a
fresh supply of flour, and before many weeks had passed
another load of wheat, after being weighed with extra
care, was hauled to the mill. The miller, in the mean
time having found some relief to his conscience by the
little he had already done, was more eager than ever to
carry out his plan and remove his burden altogether.</p>

<p>“It is certain,” he said, “they have not noticed anything
unusual in the last grist. I might just as well hurry matters
up a little. This time I’ll take out no toll at all, and
after this will begin adding some of my own flour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting off other farmers who had brought their grain
before him, the miller ground the old man’s wheat first,
out of its turn, and sent him word it was ready. His
wife, still smarting under the charge of being unjustly
suspicious, hurried him away after it, and waited his
return even more anxiously than she had for the former
load. It came in due time, and was promptly laid on
the scales as the other had been. But if she was surprised
before, she was dumb with wonder now, and her
husband—who, in truth, thought there was no better
woman—seeing her embarrassment, was considerate enough
to do no more than join in expressing his astonishment at
the unlooked-for result. The flour was quietly put away in
the store-room, and other matters requiring attention about
the farmhouse were looked after.</p>

<p>That evening, just before bedtime, as they sat together
in their old-fashioned comfortable kitchen, the farmer said
to his wife:</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about that last grist. There must
be something the matter with our young miller’s scales,
and you know that we don’t want to take without paying
for it what belongs to him. I mean to go over to the
mill to-morrow on purpose to look into it.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I want you to do,” replied his
wife, seriously. “Short of weight more than once I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
know the grinding was, and over-weight twice we both
know it was; the thing keeps worrying my mind, and
troubling me.”</p>

<p>The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, the
farmer harnessed up his horses and drove to the mill.
The miller, who was standing in the door, looked surprised
to see him when there was neither wheat to bring
nor flour to haul away. And not only surprised: there
came a look of apprehension over his face, for there is
always a lurking fear of evil in the heart that is conscious
of hiding some wrong.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you can guess what I’ve come over
about,” cried the farmer as he got down from the wagon.</p>

<p>The miller said nothing.</p>

<p>“Did you weigh the last grinding?” asked the old
man.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the one before that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you know they weighed too much? But
perhaps you wanted to make us a present,” he continued,
good-humoredly, “or maybe, as winter is coming on, you
thought we stood in need.”</p>

<p>The miller’s face grew scarlet. He attempted to speak,
but his voice stuck in his throat and he could not utter a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a><br /><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
word. Perceiving at a glance that he was in trouble, the
farmer’s manner changed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<img src="images/illus065.jpg" width="522" height="668" alt="man and wife talking by fire" />
</div>

<p>“Tell me all about it,” he said. “I was your father’s
friend, and am yours.”</p>

<p>Then the miller took the old man into the mill, and,
shutting the door, told him, in a trembling voice, the whole
sad story.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out,” he said, “that the wrong way is a
hard way, and I’m in that way yet, but I long to get out
of it. I’d give this mill—yes, and all that is in it—were
that needful to make me feel myself once more an honest
man. I have set it all aside. Those bags over there contain
every pound I have ever taken. But I shall never know
a happy moment till I see them hauled away from here
and put into your barn.”</p>

<p>“My dear young friend,” said the farmer, drawing his
sleeve across his eyes, “I care nothing for the flour,
yet it is mine, and it is right I should take it. Carry it
out yourself and load it on the wagon, and I’ll soon put
it where you want it to be. I believe you have been
taught, by the best of teachers, such a lesson as you’ll
never forget. And be assured that after it I will never
fear to trust you. Take my word for it, too, that no
one but wife—and she can keep a secret—shall ever
hear of this.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The next Sunday the miller went to church, and, whatever
else he might dread to hear about, it was not the eighth
commandment. And the following week, and for many a
week afterward, he read his newspaper as he did in former
times—all through, skipping nothing, from beginning to end.</p>

<h2>THE LARK AND THE WHIPPOORWILL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp; LARK had nearly fallen asleep in the dusk of the
evening, when a whippoorwill began calling loudly
to its mate, that was lodged in another part of the
wood:</p>

<p>“Whippoorwill! Whippoorwill!”</p>

<p>“Why do you disturb me,” asked the lark, “here at
the close of the day, when I am so tired and just ready
to take my rest?”</p>

<p>“I will try to be quiet, then,” replied the whippoorwill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>So, with a great effort, the bird kept still. Occasionally,
when its mate called from a distance, its bill <i>would</i> open
and a faint note, “Whip! Whip!” escape. But a look at
the lark, with its head under its wing, was enough to
quiet it again. And so all night long it hopped about
in silence hunting its food.</p>

<p>At last the rosy dawn appeared, and it flew down to
its humble perch near the ground and made ready to go to
sleep for the day. But just then the lark suddenly burst
forth with a loud song, and started up in its flight toward
the sky.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried the whippoorwill. “How is this?
You made me keep silence when you wanted to sleep, and
now, when it is my turn, you make more noise than I
did.”</p>

<p>“It is my nature,” cried the lark, “in the early morning
to shout out my glad song.”</p>

<p>“And it is mine,” replied the whippoorwill, “in the quiet
twilight to call to my loving mate.”</p>

<p>“I suppose what you say is true,” said the lark, “but I
am sure that I can’t help singing. Why do you not sing in
the daytime, as I do? That is the proper time.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 539px;">
<img src="images/illus071.jpg" width="539" height="645" alt="lark and whipporwill" />
</div>

<p>“Nay,” replied the whippoorwill; “as you are made
to wake and sing in the daytime, I am made to wake
and sing in the night. Now, as we can neither of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have the woods alone, let us try and put up with one
another’s songs, and so each of us enjoy its lot.”</p>

<h2>THE GATE AND GATE-POST.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp; GATE and the post that it latched to could not get
along peacefully together. The gate swagged somewhat,
and the post, instead of leaning back a little to
accommodate it, seemed purposely to lean forward. As
a consequence, there was difficulty whenever they met.
The gate accused the post of getting in the way, and the
post charged the gate with striking against it. Things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
remained in this unhappy condition for a long while, and
very often the gate might be seen swinging back and forth
in the wind, unable to latch itself, while the post showed
ugly scars on either side, which were growing uglier and
deeper every day. Neither seemed willing to yield, or even
to make the first movement toward a reconciliation.</p>

<p>At length, on a gusty morning, after a squall had
banged the gate against the post with unusual violence,
the latter said:</p>

<p>“You needn’t think I’m going to give in. That last
blow did you as much damage as it did me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to give in,” replied the gate; “all
I ask is that you lean back a little, so that I can swing
free and fasten my latch as I used to do.”</p>

<p>“It’s your own fault that you cannot do so still,” said
the post; “you began to swag and bear down on me,
and then, of course, I began to butt against you.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” replied the gate, “though I don’t agree
to all you say, I am willing to admit this much—that
there may be faults on both sides. But here we are
together, and here we’ve got to stay. I can’t go off to
look for another post, and you can’t go and hunt up
another gate. Why can’t we try and get along as we
did at first? I’m sure we were a great deal more comfortable
then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Agreed,” said the post; “I’m as tired of it as you
are. Let us from this time do all we can to keep out of
each other’s way.”</p>

<p>As this conversation took place in the early spring,
when the ground was freezing and thawing almost every
day, the two had the best possible chance of carrying
out their good resolutions; and by the help of wind and
rain, with an honest purpose on both sides, their efforts
at last were crowned with success. Then all was pleasant
and serene again. The gate swung free, the latch
caught on the post without fail, and they upheld and
supported each other, without either one trespassing on
the other’s rights.</p>

<p>But after this tranquil state of things had lasted for
some time, one day the latch, in passing, left a slight
scratch on the post’s fresh paint. At once there was
scolding and faultfinding on both sides. It was only a
scratch, to be sure, and neither seemed disposed to make
it any more; but, on the other hand, neither would recede
enough to make it any less. And so, after they had
overcome far greater difficulties, and proved that peace
and harmony were attainable, they sacrificed them both
because they could not overlook a very small offence.
The consequence was that discord reappeared between
them. When I last saw them, they were still giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
each other (not at all times, but every now and then,
when the wind was from a certain quarter) this irritating
little scratch. I suppose it is thus with them still, and
probably will be so to the end.</p>

<h2>THE WEEDY FARM.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;POOR but industrious man who rented a farm that was
badly overgrown with weeds set his heart on getting
rid of them. To do this he worked early and late. By
the dawn of day he might be seen ploughing his fields,
and because his own team (two rather sorry-looking horses)
were not strong enough to turn up the deep soil he hired
a pair of oxen and ploughed with them.</p>

<p>Afterward he went over the ground with his harrow,
from one side of the field to the other, and again across it
from end to end. He did this to break up the hard clods
and throw out the roots of the weeds, that the sun might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
scorch and kill them. Then he sowed the ground thickly
with good seed, so that if any of the roots were left they
might be crowded out by the grain. He kept on patiently
working in this way until he had gone over every part of
his farm.</p>

<p>And his labor was not in vain, for in the fields where
the corn and the oats and the rye were growing the weeds
almost disappeared. Nevertheless, as soon as it came in
turn for a field to rest and lie fallow for a season, they
were sure to show themselves again. And in the pasture-land,
that was never ploughed, they sprang up plentifully
among the grass and the clover.</p>

<p>In vain the farmer took out his scythe, searching for
the places where they grew, and cutting them down with
his own hands. There were some places that he did not
reach, and some where the roots were hidden from sight;
so that every summer they continued to mar the prospect
around him. And, as time went on, instead of getting
used to them, it seemed as if he worried over them more
and more.</p>

<p>At length, after he had been worrying thus from year
to year, he went out one gloomy autumn afternoon to walk
alone, and, seeing patches of the hated weeds here and there
all over his farm, he grew very despondent. He turned,
and came back with a heavy step to his cottage. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wife, having gotten through the rest of her work, was
sitting by the window mending his well-worn coat.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he as soon as he came in the door,
“how I’ve tried to get rid of these weeds. I’ve worked
early and late, in season and out of season, and yet there’s
not a field that has not got some of them in it. And down
in the low-lying land back of the meeting-house—I’ve just
been there—it seems to me they’re thicker than ever. I’m
discouraged. I feel like throwing up my lease and giving
up the farm, and fighting against them no longer.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said his wife as she threaded her needle
and sewed away at his patched coat, “I think you’re looking
only on one side. You haven’t worked all these years
for nothing. You’ve had pretty good crops, I think,
and it seems to <i>me</i>, the way I look at it, that this is a
very good farm, after all, the way farms go. As for
getting rid of the weeds, they were here when you came.
It’s a weedy country. I don’t believe you’ll ever be able
to get them clean out of the land. But then you’ve succeeded
in keeping them under. I reckon that if we work
hard, with the help of a kind Providence this farm will do
till we get a better. For you know we hope to move to a
better country some of these days, and to get new land
that hasn’t any weeds in it.”</p>

<p>“I declare, wife,” said the farmer, brightening up, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
do believe there’s something in what you tell me. I never
looked at it so before. I’ve been looking at the weeds, and
nothing else. We ought to look at the crops too, no doubt
since they’ve been given us in spite of the weeds. We must
put up with something, I reckon, wherever we go; so I
think we’ll just do as you say, and stay where we are, trying
nevertheless, to get the weeds out, harder and harder.
I’m glad I came straight to you. You always were a
good, sensible wife, and now I admire you more, and set
greater store by you than ever.”</p>

<h2>THE KING SEEKING CONTENT.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN king who was weary of the cares of his
high office determined to seek among his subjects for
a perfectly contented man, and, when he found him, to
exchange his throne for that man’s place, whatever it
might be. “For,” he said, “peace of mind is worth more
than even royal honors and dignities.”</p>

<p>So he disguised himself in a way that no one would
know him, and went forth on his search through the streets
of the city. And first he came into the house of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a><br /><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
who by long years of labor had heaped up great riches,
and now, having withdrawn from all business affairs, was
living in ease and luxury. But in a little while the king
saw that this life, so different from that he was accustomed
to, had become irksome and tedious, and that in
his heart he wished himself back at buying and selling
again. He looked out of his front window and said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">
<img src="images/illus085.jpg" width="521" height="647" alt="king on throne, head on hand" />
</div>

<p>“Oh that I were only in the place of my opposite
neighbor, whom I see going out early to business every
morning!”</p>

<p>Leaving this man’s house, the king found an entrance
into that of the neighbor whom he envied, who was still engrossed
in trade as the other had formerly been. Already
rich, he was adding to his wealth year by year; but in
doing this he had to labor so hard, and to carry so heavy
a load of care, that no time or space for enjoyment was
left him.</p>

<p>“I am living but a slave’s life,” he said. “Would that
I were well out of it, like my neighbor across the way,
whom I see driving out in his carriage every afternoon!”</p>

<p>Passing out of this street, where many rich merchants
lived, the king went into another, near by, and entered the
house of a man whom he himself had appointed to a responsible
post under his own government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="512" height="660" alt="king in disguise visiting carpenter" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Without the weight of anxiety which oppresses me,”
said the king, “yet with honors sufficient, and an ample
provision for all his wants, shall I not here find a happy
man?”</p>

<p>But it was not long before the king heard him, one day
when he thought he was alone, muttering to himself:</p>

<p>“Why did I ever accept this post, or choose this service
for my calling, only to bear the envy of those below
me, and the scorn of those above? How much better off
and more independent would I have been engaged in some
business of my own, like my well-to-do friends around the
corner!”</p>

<p>“I will seek for my object in a lower sphere of life and
occupation,” said the king; and, passing into an obscure
back street, he went into the shop of a mechanic who was
working at his bench with saw and plane as a carpenter.</p>

<p>“Below the level of ambition and above that of want,”
continued the king, “surely here I shall find the object of
my search.”</p>

<p>So he entered into conversation with the man, talked
with him about his trade, admired his handiwork, and
said:</p>

<p>“Whatever else you lack, my friend, I am sure that
here in perfect independence you enjoy content.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Content at this trade!” exclaimed the man. “I would
rather have been brought up to any other. What with low
wages and high lumber, there is nothing left when your
work is done. I don’t know who you may be; but if
you’re thinking of going into this business, let me warn
you against it. For my part, I don’t see why some people
have it so hard and others so easy. There’s a couple of
rich men that I work for over in the main street, that have
both of them made big fortunes since I came into this
miserable little shop. And around the corner from them
is another man I do odd jobs for—one of the king’s officers;
he has I don’t know how many servants to wait on him,
and plenty of money. Yes, and even the king himself, if
a poor man may look so high—there he is with nothing to
do but enjoy himself and rule over the rest of us. What
justice is there in all this? Everybody has all he wants,
and is happy, but me.”</p>

<p>Discouraged at his repeated failures, the king turned
away from the crowded city and went into the country.
There, as he walked along a quiet road by himself, he
came to a little cottage with a bench beside the door. In
front of it was a flower-bed filled with pinks and lady-slippers;
in the rear, a small plot of ground that appeared to
have been just digged. A shovel and a hoe were lying
there, evidently left only for the dinner-hour. The door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the cottage was open, and a laboring-man well on in
years was seen within at his noonday meal.</p>

<p>The king, in the guise of a wayfarer, stopped before the
gate, and was at once asked to enter and be seated at the
table. Accepting the invitation, he sat down and partook
of the humble repast. As soon as it was finished the two
betook themselves to the bench beside the door. Said the
king:</p>

<p>“You have a hard time, I fear, my friend. This is but
a little plot from which to get your living.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve no idea,” replied the man, “how much
this ground yields. It is planted in potatoes, and a finer
crop you never saw. I’m just digging them, and shall have
enough to last me on till spring, with some to sell—yes,
and a few to give a poor neighbor, beside.”</p>

<p>“But is that all you have to depend upon?” asked the
king.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” replied the man; “I go out to day’s work on
the farms around, and, beside being able to pay for some
new clothes, I’ve put by a barrel of flour for the winter;
it stands over in that far corner. And you see my woodpile
stretching along the fence yonder. I’ve had to work
hard for these things, but they are all that I need, and I
am content.”</p>

<p>“‘Content’!” cried the king, as though he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a><br /><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
believe his own ears. “But have you no other wants beside
these?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus091.jpg" width="520" height="661" alt="king seated on bench outside with older laborer" />
</div>

<p>“I might have,” said the man. “There are plenty that
offer me their company, but I refuse to entertain them.”</p>

<p>“Are you, then, quite satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Not with myself, but I am with my lot.”</p>

<p>At this the king was silent, for he saw that his companion
was speaking the truth, though he could not comprehend
it.</p>

<p>“But understand me,” continued the man. “It is not
because I have no trials to bear that I am content, for I
have my share of them. Here is the rheumatism in this
arm, which often will not let me sleep, and sometimes
keeps me from work for days together. And then, what
is harder still, my landlord is not always kind, or even
just.”</p>

<p>“Why, is not this cottage your own?” said the king.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” replied the man; “I’m not so rich as that.
And yet, as I was going to say, taking it all in all, I have
in my lot a bigger proportion of good than most people,
and a better chance to be what I ought to be. And to
this end I can see how even my trials are a help.”</p>

<p>The king, rising from the table, bade his humble friend
adieu and went his way, but pursued his search no
farther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have found content in another,” he said, “and
learned, too, how to get it for myself. It is to accept not
only my good things, but also my evil things, as a precious
part of my portion. I will go back to my throne esteeming
even it in this light, and so, instead of trying to cast
them off, shall be happier in bearing the burdens which
it lays upon me.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">Were we able to look into the secret thoughts of those
whom we envy, we should often find that what we covet
in their lot, is borne by them as a trial and a cross.</p>

<h2>THE LEARNED OWL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AN owl that had long separated himself from his companions
that he might devote his nights to study and
become learned, employed himself afterward in trying to
impart his learning to the other owls. Having called them
together, he discoursed about different animals and reptiles
and fishes which they had never heard of before; but he
found that, while a few seemed anxious for instruction
and listened patiently, the most of his hearers made
some excuse for flying away while he was still talking,
so that by the end of his discourse scarcely a half dozen
of them remained.</p>

<p>As he was ambitious to be considered an interesting as
well as instructive speaker, he was greatly discouraged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
this result, and at once retired to the woods, into a thick
clump of hemlocks whose dark shadows never admitted
a ray of the sun, and there, all alone, he thought over
the matter, trying to decide what was best to be done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="515" height="664" alt="parliment of owls" />
</div>

<p>He remained for several days thus engaged, when suddenly,
as if the whole difficulty were solved, he gave a
cheerful hoot, and flying forth, summoned all the owls
to a meeting in the apple-orchard near by at twelve
o’clock the following night. When the time arrived, but
a small audience appeared in the trees immediately around
him, though many were on those farther off—as we might
say, on the back seats—from which, in case they grew
weary, they could retire unseen.</p>

<p>“I’ve come this time,” he began, “not to talk about
animals or reptiles or fishes, but about owls.”</p>

<p>At once he could see an awakening of interest in the
birds that were near him. Then he went on to tell all
he knew about owls—their ancestors who had lived long
ago, the different kinds that are living now, the big owls
and the little owls, their habits, their dispositions, their
pleasures, and their pains, not, of course, omitting courtship
and marriage. Very soon he saw the birds that had
lodged on the distant trees flying nearer, and as he went
on they came one by one into the very tree where he
stood, until all the owls that lived in the neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
woods were gathered close around him; nor were they
willing to leave while he continued his discourse. And
after that, all he had to do was to vary somewhat his
treatment of the same theme to secure a punctual and
full attendance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">This fable proves that owls, like men, prefer to hear
about things in which they feel the interest of kindred.
The speaker or the book that can awaken our human
sympathies is the one, as we know, that commands the
largest audience and the closest attention.</p>

<h2>THE HORSE AND THE GRASSHOPPERS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HORSE, while feeding in a meadow, frightened the
grasshoppers at his feet, so that they flew up thickly
on every side. Some chickens, discovering this, gathered
around and accompanied him, eagerly devouring the insects.
The horse did not notice them for a time and continued
to move slowly along, thus providing them with an
abundant supply. But, at length spying them at their
repast, he suddenly raised his head, saying:</p>

<p>“How are you going to pay me back for all this trouble
I am taking for you?”</p>

<p>At which one of the chickens replied:</p>

<p>“You don’t eat grasshoppers yourself, neither are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
going out of your way to stir them up for us. Why, then,
should we pay you at all?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;">
<img src="images/illus099.jpg" width="504" height="660" alt="horse by fence, chicken at feet" />
</div>

<p>The horse, not able to answer this question, began
sullenly to feed again, when the chicken continued:</p>

<p>“If you had done us this favor willingly and kindly, we
would have eaten the grasshoppers and returned you our
thanks; but, as you do it against your will, we will eat
them just the same, and return you nothing.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">In serving our own interests we sometimes, without
intending it, serve the interest of others. It is better to do

<h2>THE BARK AND THE LIGHTSHIP.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;BARK on her outward voyage passed the lightship
moored on a shoal that lay in the track of vessels
near the coast. Said the bark as she sailed by:</p>

<p>“Here you are still, held fast by your chain, for ever
tossing and uncomfortable, but making no headway, or
profits, either.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied the lightship. “Yet this is my appointed
work. I am no idler.”</p>

<p>Long months rolled around; the bark had crossed the
ocean, and was on her homeward voyage. She neared
the land in stormy weather. Night came on, and the
lead, though it was kept going, failed to show just where
she was drifting. Then anxious fears arose, and were
growing each moment more intense, when suddenly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
bright flash gleamed through the darkness. It was the
lightship, giving warning of the shoal and pointing out
the deeper channel.</p>

<p>Once more the vessels lay side by side.</p>

<p>“You have saved me,” cried the bark, “and the rich
cargo that I carry. Now I understand why you seek not
selfish profits, and most gladly, out of gratitude, will I
share mine with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” replied the lightship; “you have sailed over
perilous seas to gain them, and they justly belong to you.
That is your calling; and the greater your gains, the
better am I pleased. But my calling is to lie here and
do what good I can. For this I receive wages sufficient
for my need, and with them I am content.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">While some men devote their lives to business and

<h2>THE UNHONORED SERVANT.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN king was accustomed from time to time to
appoint the members of his household, some of them
to be rulers over provinces, some over cities, and some to
fill private positions of honor and profit. It was considered
not only a reward of obedience, but a special
mark of his confidence and approval, to receive such
appointment.</p>

<p>After many had been thus promoted, one remained in
the palace who seemed to be overlooked and neglected.
It was evident that this was not from any fault of his
own, or from any want of regard on the part of the
king, for all could see that he was loyal and upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and enjoyed the king’s favor; yet others who had come
later into the palace were chosen before him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/illus105.jpg" width="516" height="660" alt="man telling story to ruler on throne" />
</div>

<p>At length one of the king’s counsellors ventured to
ask him the reason of this, saying:</p>

<p>“This man for many years has obeyed you with all
faithfulness and devotion, yet others are sent forth to
fill stations of honor, while he remains here in his place
as a servant. Why is this?”</p>

<p>The king answered:</p>

<p>“I keep him thus, not as a mark of my displeasure
or of his want of desert, but because he is the one whom
I cannot part with, even to bestow honors and riches
upon him, but must have ever near me. Neither will
he be a loser by it in the end.”</p>

<h2>WINGS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE a caterpillar, as it fed on a tree, was given the
power of speech. It said:</p>

<p>“What wonderful eyes I have! I can see the whole of
this leaf at one time—not only the part I am feeding on,
but its whole length and breadth.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you,” replied the tree, “there are eyes that
can see not only one leaf, but all the leaves on a tree—yes,
and on a whole woods—at a glance.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said the caterpillar, “and then it is
only doing what I do, though on a larger scale.—And what
wonderful feet I have!” continued the caterpillar. “I can
creep from the ground up to your topmost bough, between
the rising and the setting of the sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I can tell you,” replied the tree, “there are feet
that can pass over a space equal to that in a moment, and
in one short hour can go farther than you in all the days
of your life.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said the caterpillar, “and then it is
only doing what I do, though on a larger scale.”</p>

<p>“But this is not all I have to tell you,” continued the
tree. “There are beings that can dart from the ground up
to my highest branch without so much as touching me with
their feet, and that can pass swiftly from tree to tree,
borne through the air on wings.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” said the caterpillar. “There may
be stronger eyes that can see farther even than mine, and
quicker feet that can travel faster; but, as for wings to fly
through the air with, that cannot be. You are talking of
things you know nothing about, or else are only trying to
deceive me. After such an absurd statement, I will not
listen to you any more, or believe anything you say.”</p>

<p>The summer passed, and autumn came with its cloudy
days and chilly nights. The leaves of the tree shrivelled
up and dropped to the ground, and one frosty morning the
caterpillar was found suspended from a naked twig by a
thread of its own spinning, shut up in its cocoon. And
there it slept, unconscious from day to day, and month to
month, through the long winter. The fierce storm could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
not weaken its hold, or shake it loose, as it hung secure,
tossed to and fro by the blast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/illus109.jpg" width="452" height="640" alt="stages of butterfly's life cycle" />
</div>

<p>But at length spring approached. The buds began to
swell and the young leaves to appear. The blossoms on
the fruit trees opened, and the birds sang among them.
And one morning the imprisoned caterpillar revived in its
narrow cell, and, rending its walls asunder, came forth and
basked in the sunshine. But what are these at its side
gently expanding and unfolding? It spreads them forth,
and, loosening its hold upon the twig, floats away on the
breeze. It mounts up, it flies, it lodges on a lofty bough,
and flies from one to another again and again.</p>

<p>“Was it I,” it says, astonished, “that declared there
were no beings with wings, and that to pass from place to
place through the air was impossible? Now am I made to
see that it was not the tree, but myself, who spoke about
things I knew nothing of; now am I made to feel the denseness
of my own ignorance. If this, which is so unlooked
for and so far beyond the reach of my understanding, has
been done to me, I will wait and see what yet remains to
be done, nor ever again limit the power that created me at
first, and still goes on perfecting its own work.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;POOR man who supported his family by daily labor
used to deal with the two storekeepers of his native
village. Of one he bought flour and meat; of the other,
materials for his own and his children’s clothing. Being
a good workman and honest as well as industrious, he was
accustomed to settle his accounts at both stores every Saturday
night.</p>

<p>All went on well and to the satisfaction of both buyer
and seller as long as health lasted. But at length sickness
came, and Saturday brought the laborer no wages. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he hoped for the return of strength by another week, and
then to be at work again. But strength did not return.
Week after week passed, and it seemed farther away than
ever. The storekeepers’ accounts remained unsettled. The
matter was becoming a serious one for them. What should
they do?</p>

<p>At this point one of them opened his ledger, went over
every item set down there, and, after footing up the total
amount, calculated the interest on it to the last cent. Then
he sat thinking about what he could do with the money if
he only had it in hand; and this was the standpoint from
which <i>he</i> looked at the debt.</p>

<p>The other storekeeper also went over his ledger and
footed up the amount. But after doing so he shut the
book up again, and, putting on his hat, went to see the
man who owed him the money. Entering his humble
cottage, he sat down at his bedside and looked into his
honest, suffering face, and on his wife and children in
poverty around him; and here was the standpoint from
which <i>this</i> storekeeper looked at the debt.</p>

<p>The sick man died, and his family was left penniless.
The storekeeper who had visited him, still looking at the
debt, as it were, from the lowly bedside, thought it was
right to cross it off his books and forgive it altogether.
The other storekeeper, viewing it from his counting-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a><br /><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
only, thought it right to get the money if he could. Had
he not furnished all the articles that were charged for?
Had not the man’s family taken them and used them? The
money was his, and he meant to have it. So he held the
dead man’s wife and children responsible, and, though they
had a hard time to earn their daily bread, he made it harder
by demanding something each month till the last cent was
paid.</p>

</div>

<p>Time rolled on, and the years that gather, an ever-increasing
load, upon poor and rich alike, began to bow the
forms of the two storekeepers. Old age overtook them,
and finally the hour when each in turn must leave store
and ledger to know them no more. Then it was found
that he who had remitted the poor man’s debt had left
to his family a moderate competency, with a good many
accounts in his ledger balanced by the one word written
over against them, “<span class="smcap">Forgiven</span>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/illus115.jpg" width="517" height="668" alt="man talking to seated sewing woman" />
</div>

<p>The other storekeeper had left his family rich, with
scarcely an account that had ever been due him unpaid,
and the few that were, remained so only because neither
force nor persuasion could bring the money. But in
the village where they had lived and died it was noticed,
long after both storekeepers and their ways of doing
business were forgotten, that the smaller inheritance increased
in the hands of those who received it, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the larger one, in the hands receiving it, seemed mysteriously
to melt away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">According to the standpoint from which we look at a
thing will be our views of right and wrong respecting it;
but we are accountable for the choice of that standpoint.</p>

<h2>THE MAN WITH A MENAGERIE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who kept a menagerie had trouble with several
of the wild beasts, which, although they were confined
in strong cages, sometimes became excited and made
violent efforts to escape. There was one in particular—a
tiger—that caused him special concern. By continued
watchfulness and careful treatment, however, the animal
was at length brought into a quiet and submissive state,
seeming to be asleep most of the time. Nevertheless,
knowing his savage nature, his owner was diligent in
examining the different parts of his cage—the iron bars in
front, and the bolts in the rear—every day.</p>

<p>But, after doing this for many weeks without a recurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of any cause for alarm, the man dismissed his fears
and began to forget there had ever been any cause for them.
Then, insensibly to himself, he relaxed his vigilance, until
the matter passed out of his mind and he thought no more
about the tiger than he did about the antelope, the deer,
or any other harmless specimens in his collection.</p>

<p>This state of things had lasted without any mishap for
a long time, when one day, while passing through his menagerie,
as he came in front of the tiger’s cage he made a
misstep; his foot slipped, and he fell. Like a flash—as
soon as he saw him fall—the tiger sprang to his
feet and dashed with savage fury against the bars in front
of him, which, not being properly secured, parted and
allowed him to pass between them.</p>

<p>As he lighted on the ground all the weak and defenceless
animals around him were panic-stricken, uttering cries
of terror. And truly it looked for the moment as though
he might slay both them and their fallen master unrestrained.
To make it worse, his keeper, who alone had
any control over him, was absent, but fortunately not
beyond the sound of the tumult. This man hastened to
the rescue, and by skill in soothing as well as courage in
quelling succeeded after a time in getting the brute back
to his den.</p>

<p>Then was the owner glad, breathing freely once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Yet for hours afterward his face remained pale and his
hand trembled.</p>

<img src="images/illus119.jpg" width="518" height="667" alt="tiger over man on floor; man in background with stick" />
</div>

<p>“I am thankful,” he said, “for this great deliverance.
Never shall I forget it, nor lessen my watchfulness over
this furious beast’s cage; for no matter how silent it seems,
or how little danger appears to be within, I know only too
well that the tiger is there still.”</p>

<h2>TWO OUTLOOKS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO persons live in the same house, which has both a
front and a back view. The front view is over a quiet
lake, with green fields and mountains beyond—beautiful
always, in summer, in autumn, in winter. The back view
is hemmed in by old broken-down walls, ruinous outbuildings
and a pigsty.</p>

<p>One of the inmates of the house takes her work and
sits habitually by the front window. Her face is bright
and beaming, and the neighbors often hear her sing.</p>

</div>

<p>The other inmate sits constantly looking out of the
back window. The gloomy prospect depresses and sours
her; and when she does open her lips, it is generally to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
complain. Yet neither of these persons is forced to gaze
thus on the prospect which so affects her. Each sits by
the window she has chosen for herself.</p>

<p>Now, we all live in houses with front windows and
back windows. At which of them do we choose, for the
most of our time, to sit?</p>

<h2>JOB NICKEL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN by the name of Job Nickel, who was about
emigrating to a new home, bought a stout horse and
strong wagon—the best his means would afford—and,
packing his family into it, with such household goods as
could be carried beside, started on his journey. He had
not gone far when he was overtaken by another family
travelling in the same direction, but driving a pair of
fine horses to a handsome carriage. The difference in
outfit, however, did not prevent the occupants of the
carriage from making acquaintance with the family in
the wagon. They first looked at them smilingly, then
nodded, and presently got into conversation.</p>

<p>As their destination was the same and it was pleasanter
to travel in company than alone, Job gave his horse a sharp
cut, to keep up with his new friends; and the travellers
kept together until night, when, coming to a green spot
with a spring of pure water upon it, they encamped there,
as is the custom with emigrants on the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, before harnessing up, the occupants
of the carriage begged Job to let his eldest daughter—a
bright little girl of twelve—ride with them. The child’s
mother and Job himself were pleased at this attention,
and after fishing out her best dress from the bottom of a
chest, and hastily putting it on, the invitation was accepted.
But when they started for the day, the pair
travelled so much faster than the one horse that the
carriage soon left the wagon behind; sometimes it was
visible a good way ahead, and sometimes was quite out
of sight. Yet, as his little girl was in it, Job felt bound
to keep as near it as he could, though this required, especially
in going-up hill, the constant urging of his horse
and not unfrequent use of the whip.</p>

<p>While hurrying along the road in this way Job came
up with a neighbor who, like himself, drove only one
horse. But so anxious was Job to get on that he passed
his old friend without speaking. It must be admitted, too,
that Job felt with his new acquaintance, if he could only
keep up with them, he was travelling in more distinguished
company. Thus the second day passed, and the travellers
again encamped together, Job, after taking the harness off
his own horse, helping to unharness the pair.</p>

<p>The next morning his friends consented to let the little
girl return to her parents in the wagon provided her brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a><br /><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
be allowed to take her place. So the girl went back, very
much dissatisfied, and the boy succeeded her. And thus
the two vehicles continued in company day after day.
Sometimes the boy was in the carriage, and sometimes the
girl; and once one of the children from the carriage came
and rode in the wagon. Meanwhile, the intimacy between
the families constantly increased, no account being taken
of their differing circumstances. While these things were
going on, both Job and his wife could not help secretly
thinking that, as their children happened to be of like
ages, this intimacy might some day become closer still;
yet neither one (as they felt in their hearts ashamed of it)
mentioned this thought to the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/illus127.jpg" width="517" height="668" alt="loading up the wagon" />
</div>

<p>But all this time, notwithstanding his apparent friendship,
the owner of the carriage never once slackened his
pace to accommodate Job. As a consequence, the work
of keeping up with him became harder than ever. Job
had now to lash his horse at almost every step, by doing
which he was just able to follow close at the tail of the
carriage. But in dry weather he was always in a cloud
of dust, and in wet weather was being splashed with the
mud thrown up by the wheels in front of him; so that,
wet or dry, he was equally miserable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/illus129.jpg" width="511" height="655" alt="Job striving to keep upover hard road" />
</div>

<p>But the worst was yet to come. After Job had been
thus laboriously working his way for about half the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
he was to travel, one morning, on going out early
to feed his horse, the animal was found still lying down;
and when Job tried to rouse him, he refused to get up—alas!
with good reason: he could not. And within an
hour the poor overworked beast was dead.</p>

<p>By this time the sun had risen, and the carriage was all
ready to start; but before doing so the family that travelled
in it came over to where Job stood, showing great pity for
him. They were loud in their expressions of sorrow, but
the father said, as he had promised to be at a point beyond
by a certain hour, he would have to go on. Just then
another carriage, containing some of his acquaintance,
came along, and he cracked his whip and was soon out
of sight. As he drove off Job saw for the first time the
man’s name—S. Silver. It was printed upon the end of a
trunk which they had taken from the inside and put on the
top of the carriage.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Job, “now I know who he is. His
first name is Sterling. He had a bank in the county-town
next to ours, and a sad fool has poor Job Nickel been in
trying all this while to keep up with Sterling Silver! I
deserve all I have got.—Well, wife,” he continued, “here
we are with our horse dead, our grand acquaintances gone,
and plenty of time to reflect on our folly.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 518px;">
<img src="images/illus131.jpg" width="518" height="614" alt="family saddened over loss of horse" />
</div>

<p>As he spoke his old friend with the one horse, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Job had passed on the road without noticing, came trudging
comfortably by. Job turned toward him ready to
speak, but the man did not notice him. As he disappeared
Job looked around at his wife, and, seeing
her wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron, he
said:</p>

<p>“Happily, my dear, we’ve got a small sum left in the
bottom of the chest, with which we’ll try to buy another
horse—the best we can get for it. But after this we’ll go
along at our own gait, no matter who goes before or follows
after us.”</p>

<h2>THE UNUSED LOOM.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who had inherited a plain but comfortable house
with a lot of ground around it went there to live. He
found, on looking through the house, that, beside the furniture
it contained suitable to his daily wants, there was in one
of the upper rooms a curiously-made loom. It was a complicated
machine, and he could see at a glance a valuable
one; but he could see also that it would require his best
skill as well as a good deal of hard work to keep it in
motion. Not caring to put these forth just then, instead
of attempting to run it, he let it stand.</p>

<p>As he had to earn his living, however, and was not, in
truth, a lazy man, he employed himself in other ways,
tilling his ground and, when he had that in perfect order
for the time being, hiring himself out to do farm-work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
his neighbors. But he was, at best, a poor hand at this
sort of work, an ordinary day-laborer easily outstripping
him; so that, although he managed to live, by the end of
the year, if he was not actually behindhand, he was sure
to have nothing over.</p>

<p>But while he worked in the soil he never forgot his
loom. And sometimes when the work was harder and
money scarcer than usual he would go up to the room
where it was stored, and open the door and stand looking
at it. Yet as soon as he realized afresh the labor both
of mind and body required to run it, he shut to the door
again and went back to day’s work with his pick and
shovel.</p>

<p>But at length his pressing needs and a deepening conviction
that he could better his condition induced him to
undertake what he had shrunk from so long; he began
clearing away from his loom the dust and dirt that had
accumulated about it, determined to persevere until he
had put it in perfect running order. And, having once
begun the work, he found at each step of its progress that
his interest increased, and that the strength and skill required
were forthcoming as occasion demanded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">
<img src="images/illus135.jpg" width="521" height="662" alt="man looking in storage room" />
</div>

<p>Finally, every part being ready, he put in the warp and
the shuttle, and set it in motion. Then he himself was surprised
at the result. The fabric it wove was both serviceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and beautiful, and there was at once a demand for all
he could make. The people of the village where he lived,
and of the neighborhood for miles around, flocked to his
house to secure it; and he felt for the first time, though
after many precious years had been wasted, that he was
engaged in the work he was best qualified for. And while
serving others he was also benefiting himself; for, instead
of making but a bare living, as before, he was able
now to lay up a considerable sum from his earnings every
year.</p>

<h2>CROWING.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">EARLY one morning, while the fowls were waiting
around the kitchen door for their breakfast, a spring
chicken attempted to crow, but succeeded only in uttering
a feeble squawk.</p>

<p>A young cock, hearing this, stood up and crowed loud
and clear, saying to the other:</p>

<p>“You’d better be still till you can crow like that.”</p>

<p>To which a guinea-hen that was restlessly flitting about
replied with a shrill, high voice:</p>

<p>“It was only the spring before last when you did no
better yourself!”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said the cock. “It must be some other
chicken you are thinking of.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied the guinea. “I remember you ever
since you were hatched—while you were a little chick
sleeping under your mother’s wing, when you grew bigger
and first flew up to the roost, and how like this spring
chicken’s your crowing was then, only with this difference:
you were so conceited that the whole barnyard was laughing
at you. All this is forgotten now, luckily for you.
But take my advice: be tender of the failings of others,
lest your own be recalled and displayed in full light.”</p>

<h2>PETER CRISP’S SPECTACLES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">PETER CRISP had something the matter with his eyes;
he needed spectacles to help him see. But this was
no uncommon misfortune: hundreds of people who do ten
good hours’ work every day, use spectacles, and cannot
get along without them. No; the trouble in Peter’s case
was not in having to wear spectacles, but in the particular
kind of spectacles that he wore. They seemed to have the
strange quality of undergoing a change of color at certain
times; so that everything seen through them underwent a
corresponding change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time they took on a dark color—almost black.
And, as this made everything look dark and gloomy, he
was made to feel accordingly.</p>

<p>“I could iron these collars better myself,” he exclaimed
one morning as he was dressing, after putting on these
glasses. And a few moments later: “Not a single pin in
this cushion, as usual!” And presently again: “Who <i>has</i>
taken away my comb and brush?” though both of these
useful articles were lying within his reach, and just where
he himself had left them.</p>

<p>Had any of the children chanced to come into the room
about that time, it would have been an unlucky visit for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>When he sat down to breakfast, it was with a frown upon
his brow, and a deep wrinkle between his eyes, caused,
apparently, by the weight of the spectacles.</p>

<p>“Bridget never did make a good cup of coffee in her
life,” he remarked.—“My dear,” he continued, turning to
his wife, “I do wish you would take the trouble to go down
once—<i>only</i> once—and show her how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Crisp ventured to answer in a meek voice that she
went down every morning. Peter had no reply—especially
no thanks—to offer for this; but he took another sip,
puckered up his lips as though he had swallowed a dose
of medicine, and pushed the cup away from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>After this cheerful breakfast he put on his hat to go to
the store (for Peter was a business-man); but when he had
gone as far as the front door, he came back with a quick
step to the foot of the stairs, and there stood calling out
in a loud voice that he really felt ashamed at the condition
of the steps and the sidewalk. No others in the neighborhood,
he declared, looked so shabby.</p>

<p>In the street a few minutes afterward he was joined by
a fellow business man, and as they walked down town
together Peter was as gay and lively as any one could
have wished him to be. The two talked with each other
about the fine weather and their prosperous trade, and
even touched on their happy families. And when they spied
a bachelor-friend in the distance, Peter grew merry at his
expense, and expressed pity for him as a poor fellow who
had no home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>But when, a little later, he entered his counting-room
alone, it was plain he had the dark glasses on still. Not
a man about the establishment worked as he should do, he
said. It used to be different when he was a boy. Then he
turned and went out of the house with a look of disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he was gone the bookkeeper scolded the clerk,
the clerk scolded the boy, and the boy went out to the front
door and abused the porter. And after that, throughout
the day, everything seemed to go wrong with Peter himself
and all who were about him; yet surely the fault was
his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>A few mornings after this it seemed as though Peter’s
glasses had undergone another change. They appeared
now to be of a blue color. He was in a milder frame, but
low in spirits. He was sorry to see the nursery carpet
wearing out, for he did not know where another would
come from. At breakfast he watched the children taking
butter, and took hardly any himself. He begged Mrs.
Crisp to put less sugar in his coffee. The frown was gone
from his brow but a most dejected look had taken its place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a><br /><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Spying a hole in the toe of his boy’s shoe, he drew a long
breath; and, hearing that the dressmaker was engaged to
come the next week for his daughters, he sighed aloud.
On his way down town, walking alone (for he avoided
company), he looked as if he had lost a near relation, and
at the store all day seemed to feel like a man who was just
on the eve of failing in business, though there was, in truth,
no danger of his doing any such thing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus157.jpg" width="404" height="526" alt="Peter looking sadly at carpet while wife looks at him" />
</div>


<p>There was one more change that Peter’s glasses used to
undergo. The color which they then assumed could never
be exactly made out, but it seemed to be more of a smoky
hue than anything else. This did not come upon them so
often as either of the others, but when it did it had a very
singular effect. The glasses then seemed to befog Peter
rather than help him see. For after putting them on when
he got up of a morning, he would dress without speaking
a word. At breakfast he would say nothing, and make it
plain that he did not want anybody else to. Consequently,
the whole family, little and big, would sit and munch their
food in silence. Then he would rise up from the table and
walk out of the house as if he were dumb. And although
it was a relief when he had gone, and made matters something
better, a chilling influence remained behind him the
whole day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/illus159.jpg" width="401" height="527" alt="Peter sees hole in son's shoe" />
</div>


<p>Peter had been wearing these glasses a good many years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
when, as he was meditating alone one evening, he thought
to himself that things never looked very cheerful in his
eyes and he was never very happy, and it occurred to him
that perhaps his spectacles had something to do with it.
Then he remembered that a neighbor of his, one Samuel
Seabright, who also wore glasses and often used to complain
of them, now seemed to have gotten over his trouble
and always to have a pleasant face on. Meeting Samuel
the next morning, he said:</p>

<p>“Neighbor, if it is not making too free, may I ask what
was the matter with your spectacles when I used to hear
you find fault with them so often?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you may,” replied Samuel, “for I have not
the least objection to tell you. They used to get strange
shades and colors over them; so that nothing looked
natural or as it ought to look, and of course this affected
my spirits.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” said Peter. “And have they got
perfectly clear and transparent now?”</p>

<p>“Clear as crystal; so that everything looks just right,
and they give me no trouble at all.”</p>

<p>“And would you mind telling me how you got them
so?”</p>

<p>“I went to the doctor’s, and did exactly as he directed.”</p>

<p>“And can you tell me where that doctor lives?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/illus161.jpg" width="396" height="525" alt="Peter talking to neighbour" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course I can. You remember that large stone
building with a beautiful stained-glass window at one end
of it, and a high tower on top, with a chime of bells in the
tower?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; I pass it every day.”</p>

<p>“Well, the doctor lives next door to that.”</p>

<p>That very day Peter stopped at the doctor’s house and
rang the bell, and was shown into his office. The doctor
himself was there, and after looking into Peter’s eyes
began to ask him questions.</p>

<p>“Do you walk much in the open air?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, every day,” replied Peter, “but it is mostly in
going down to my store and back again. Though sometimes
of an afternoon my wife and I stroll out together.”</p>

<p>“What streets do you generally walk in?”</p>

<p>“Only the best-kept and most respectable streets.”</p>

<p>“Are you in the habit of visiting much?”</p>

<p>“A good deal.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, then, you are kept up late at night sometimes?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/illus163.jpg" width="407" height="530" alt="talking with the doctor" />
</div>

<p>“I can’t help it. You see, my relations, almost all of
them—I may say all that I keep up any acquaintance with—are
rich people. Now, last night I was at my uncle’s
house. He had just finished papering his parlor with the
most beautiful paper I ever saw. Then he had newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
covered his furniture with satin damask, and bought carpets
and curtains to match, and he kept me looking at
these things ever so long.”</p>

<p>“Are you often kept up in this way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite often. The night before that I went to my
cousin’s. He gave a very handsome dinner. There were
fifteen courses set on the table. I am sure his dinner cost
enough to feed a plain family of moderate size, for half a
year. But nobody was there except the most select and
fashionable people. To tell you the truth, doctor, these
are pretty much the only kind of people I visit. They
live in fine houses, with large rooms that are well ventilated
and well lighted, and I don’t see how my eyes, or
my spectacles, either, can get any harm while I am there.
Indeed, I am longing all the time for the day when I can
live in such a house myself, instead of the little pinched-up
dwelling I have to stay in now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have formed my opinion about your case,”
said the doctor, “and am ready to say what you should
do. But I must tell you beforehand that it will be different
from what you expect, and probably from what you would
choose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that,” replied Peter, “I am not at all particular;
you will find me willing to do whatever you
say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“The first thing I want is that you should stop walking
in those broad, sunny, handsome streets, and walk through
the narrower and poorer streets, where there is not such a
glare of light.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to walk in them, for I don’t care to be
seen in any but the most respectable streets.”</p>

<p>“Well, then there is no use of my prescribing for you
any further.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it comes to that, I’ll do it; for I want to get my
eyes well more than anything else.”</p>

<p>“The next thing is that you should stop occasionally
and rest while you are walking there, and call at some of
the houses in those streets.”</p>

<p>“Why, doctor, I can’t see how that could possibly do
me any good. As I have told you already, the houses
where I visit are among the finest in town, well ventilated
and heated, and some of them are just getting in the new
electric—”</p>

<p>“Very well,” interrupted the doctor; “it is for you to
say whether you will do as I prescribe or not.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I will have to do it, then, though I have
never visited such places in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Stop here to-morrow afternoon, after business-hours,”
continued the doctor, “and, as you are not used to such
calls, I will go with you to make a beginning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day Peter’s glasses gave him more trouble
than usual, and he was at the doctor’s office punctually by
the time appointed. The doctor did not keep him waiting,
but put on his hat and led him a considerable distance, to
quite another part of the town from that in which he was
in the habit of walking. It had once been a fashionable
part, but was deserted long ago by the richer class, and
was now tenanted by only the poorest people. The houses
had a decayed, tumble-down look; the front doors (once so
jealously guarded) were standing wide open, the halls
scarred and bare-looking, every room being occupied by
an entire family.</p>

<p>Going into one of these houses, the doctor led Peter up
to the third story. There he knocked at a door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said a faint voice.</p>

<p>Entering, they saw a poor woman sitting in an armchair.
She was moving her head from side to side in the
effort to get her breath. A bottle of medicine stood on a
rickety table near by. The bedstead at her side, covered
over with a counterpane, was evidently without a mattress,
or anything else save the canvas sacking, to lie on. Two
little girls, pale and scantily clad, shrank back to a corner
as the visitors entered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/illus169.jpg" width="402" height="532" alt="visiting a poor woman and her family" />
</div>

<p>The doctor sat down beside the poor sufferer, and after
inquiring about her sickness led her on gently to tell something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a><br /><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of her past history—how in her youth, in her father’s
house, she had every want supplied; how she had married
with bright prospects, and for a time been happy, until her
husband, fallen through drink from one depth of poverty to
another, had at last left her and her little ones to starve,
except for the kindness of those who took pity on them.</p>

<p>“Yet God has taken care of me,” she said, “in all my
troubles, and I know he will keep on doing so. Yesterday
I awoke in the morning and sat up on the edge of my bed,
and cried, for I did not know where a mouthful of food was
to come from for me and my children. But before night I
had plenty.”</p>

<p>Peter looked from her face to the doctor’s while she was
speaking. He knew that the doctor was familiar with such
scenes, yet he saw him put his finger up to his eye and
draw it across the lids to prevent a tear from falling.</p>

<p>Coming out of this house and walking a little way, the
doctor turned into a narrow alley that led back from the
main street. Here he entered a house that was shut in
from the air and the light by high walls on every side.
In a lower room of this house was a man, tall and of large
frame, once evidently very strong, but now pale and weak,
looking as if he were hardly able to stand. Five young
children, in various degrees of raggedness, and the man’s
wife were with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/illus171.jpg" width="407" height="534" alt="visiting a poor man and his family" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter looked around the room. The walls had been so
often covered with whitewash that it stood out in layers
and ridges upon them, except in some spots where the
plaster had fallen off, leaving the lath bare underneath.
Peter could not help thinking of the beautiful paper in
his rich uncle’s house.</p>

<p>The doctor asked how they had got along since he last
saw them. It was but poorly, they said. The father had
been able to work only a few days—two or three in a week—and
the mother had to make up for the rest. Beside
doing the work at home, she went out washing and scrubbing
almost every day.</p>

<p>“But it is hard on us,” she said; “he needs good food,
and we can’t get it. I do all I can, but it’s not a great deal,
for it pulls me down so. I feel tired all the time—when I
go to bed at night, and when I get up in the morning.”</p>

<p>As she spoke Peter thought that her thin, worn face
told her story even more pitifully than her words did.</p>

<p>It was quite late when they got through this visit, but
the doctor walked with Peter all the way to his home,
talking with him about his own ailment and telling him
what he ought to do. “For,” he said, “the trouble with
your eyes is a serious one which comes from something
worse than poor spectacles, and is often more deeply seated
even than the eye itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus173.jpg" width="408" height="534" alt="visiting sick man in bed" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>As they parted he said:</p>

<p>“I want you to be at my office again at the same hour
to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>Peter was there at the time named, and the doctor took
him in still another direction, to a street near the water.
Here, entering a narrow but very high house, the doctor
led him up a dark winding stair. It was so dark that
Peter had to grope his way, for he could not see a step
before him. They came at last to the garret, which the
doctor entered without knocking. The windows of this
room opened toward the river, and the masts of ships were
visible rising above the roofs of the houses that stood
between. A seaman’s chest, a chair and a broken,
propped-up bedstead were all the furniture the room
contained.</p>

<p>On the bed lay an old white-haired man. He had been
a sailor, and his seamed and rugged face still told of his
hard life upon the deck, and on the mast, amid wind and
storm.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with him?” asked Peter, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Nothing but old age,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“And what has he to live upon?” continued Peter.</p>

<p>“Only the wages of his weak and sickly boy,” said the
doctor, “who leaves him in the morning to go to his work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and returns at night when his day’s work is done. The
long hours between he spends here alone.”</p>

<p>The old man put his hand upon his breast, saying that
he felt pain and a smothering feeling there.</p>

<p>“And what do you do, my old friend,” asked Peter,
“while you are lying here all by yourself, if you want
anything? Suppose you want a drink?”</p>

<p>“I do without it,” replied the old man.</p>

<p>The doctor leaned over the bed and talked kindly to
him, comforting him, and then placed a piece of money
in his trembling hand.</p>

<p>As he and Peter came down the winding stair together
the doctor said in a low voice, “It is not likely he will
suffer long.”</p>

<p>When they regained the street, the doctor told Peter
there was yet another visit they could pay that same
afternoon if they quickened their steps; and he led the
way to a neighborhood not far off, where some great cotton-mills
stood. Here, in a small house, and living in one
little room, were two old women who were sisters. A tiny
stove stood in the room with about a double handful of coal
burning in it. A bucket partly filled with coal (which they
bought by the bucket only) stood beside it. A single strip
of rag carpet lay along the middle of the well-scrubbed
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/illus176.jpg" width="403" height="525" alt="visting two old sisters" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>In a tin cup over the fire a small quantity of meal was
boiling, and in a bowl on the table was a little milk. A
few pieces of bread were lying near it. (His cousin’s
elegant dinner here recurred to Peter’s mind.)</p>

<p>One of the old women was bedridden, but was now
sitting up in her bed; and both were at work unwinding
great skeins of yarn, parting the different colors and winding
these up again into separate balls. This was for one of
the mills in the neighborhood. Both of the old bodies were
cheerful, and showed great pleasure when the doctor came
in. The well one bustled about and set out a chair for him,
and another for Peter. The doctor sat down and talked
with them, and listened to all they had to say.</p>

<p>“Sister has been a good deal better for the past
week,” said the well one, “and the mills are busy, and we
have plenty of work.”</p>

<p>“But your rent?” asked the doctor. “It comes due
soon, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We have it all made up,” said the old woman, triumphantly.
“It is in yonder bureau-drawer, ready now.
God has been very good to us. We don’t want any help
this time.”</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the doctor and Peter came out
of the little house. As they were about to part, the doctor
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-morrow I will take you to another quarter and
introduce you to some of my friends there.”</p>

<p>“I believe, my kind friend,” replied Peter, in a subdued
voice, “that this will be needless. Your wise treatment
has reached the seat of the disease. I feel my sight growing
clearer every hour.”</p>

<p>Then, hastily bidding his companion “Good-bye,” Peter
turned toward his home. He walked with a brisk step,
feeling, somehow or other, as if he could hardly get there
soon enough. As he entered the door he heard the merry
voices of his children up stairs. He went into the dining-room.
No one was there, but the fire was burning brightly
in the stove, and a plentiful evening meal was already
spread upon the table. Peter stood for a moment silent
and alone. The sofa, the chairs, all the objects around
him—-not luxurious and elegant, but comfortable and
abundant—-looked different from what they used to look.
The place seemed filled with blessings.</p>

<p>“And is it possible,” he exclaimed, “my eyes have been
so blinded that I have never before been able to see them?”</p>

<p>Just then his wife came into the room. He went to
her, took her hand tenderly in his, and told her where he
had been, what he had seen, and how differently he felt.</p>

<p>“But,” said she, with a loving smile and an arch look,
“how about those badly-ironed collars that we heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a><br /><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the other morning, and the dusty steps, and the weak
coffee?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/illus179.jpg" width="401" height="526" alt="man looking about room with new eyes" />
</div>

<p>“Oh,” he cried, “how could I ever let such trifles
trouble me?”</p>

<p>“And then,” she continued, “the nursery carpet that is
wearing out, and the boy’s shoes, and the girls’ dresses?”</p>

<p>“As for them,” he said, “we will hope to get more when
they are gone. But with even half our present comforts
and indulgences, and with you, my dearest, and our
precious children about me, I trust I may feel too rich
ever again to utter one complaining word.”</p>

<p>So the dark shadows were driven away from Peter
Crisp’s spectacles, and he and all his family ever after led
a happier life, because he had found what he never possessed
before—<small>A THANKFUL HEART</small>.</p>

</div>




<h2>THE TWO APPLE TREES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO apple trees that stood on opposite sides of the
road, being both of them neglected by their owners,
used to sympathize with each other’s misfortunes.</p>

<p>“Just look at the suckers that are allowed to spring
up about my roots!” said one.</p>

<p>“And see the great nests of caterpillars that remain
undisturbed among my branches!” said the other.</p>

<p>But after a while the farm on which one of the trees
stood was sold, and it soon became evident that its new
owner was a very different farmer from the old one. He
began straightening up his fences, whitewashing his buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a><br /><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and putting things to rights all over his farm. His
fields were ploughed, his garden planted, his fruit trees
attended to—among the rest, the apple tree that stood near
the road. Its dead wood was cut out, the caterpillars it had
complained of were cleared away, and the ground about
its roots was loosened and enriched.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus183.jpg" width="530" height="672" alt="apple trees with road between" />
</div>

<p>As a consequence, when spring arrived, it was covered
with blossoms, and later in the summer loaded down with
fruit.</p>

<p>But while all this was going on it had noticed a strange
alteration in its opposite neighbor. Formerly the two trees
used to talk together every day, but now very little passed
between them. The one across the road seemed unwilling
to talk and grew more and more silent, until, when autumn
came and the great red apples were being gathered from
the branches of its old acquaintance, it would scarcely
return an answer when spoken to. The other bore this
for a time, but at length could bear it no longer, and
then spoke out plainly, as follows:</p>

<p>“You will hardly answer me when I speak to you.
What a change is this in an old friend! Yet I have done
nothing to make you dislike me. I am left to imagine only
one cause for it, and that is jealousy, and regret, at my
greater good fortune.”</p>

<p>“You wrong me,” replied the fruitless tree—“not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
charging me with unkind treatment, which I acknowledge,
but in the motive you have imputed it to. It is not because
I am sorry for your good fortune, but because I am ashamed
of my own unhappy condition, that I am so silent. I would
not strip from you one green leaf or have you to bear one
apple less, but in looking at your prosperous state I am
made more conscious of my own poverty, and realize what

<p>“Pardon me,” said the other. “Instead of being angry
I am sorry for you, and hope with all my heart that by next
spring you may fall into better hands, and by autumn be
more heavily loaded down with fruit than myself.”</p>

<h2>THE SPRING IN THE WOODS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SPRING of pure water bubbled up from the ground
in the midst of a wood, but the trees, after sheltering
it for a season, began to complain of it as an intruder.</p>

<p>“You take up too much of our room,” they said,
“where more trees might grow. Then, our underbrush,
that we depend on for the future, is trampled down and
spoiled by the animals that come trooping every day to
your side. You have no right to occupy our space, and
we warn you to be gone.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, the spring sent word down to its hidden
source, deep in the ground, bidding its streams seek another
outlet in a grove near by. Soon afterward its waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a><br /><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
began to disappear from the wood, sinking lower and
lower, until, instead of the glassy mirror in which the
trees used to see their branches reflected, only a dusty
hollow remained. Nor was this all. Hot and dry weather
came on soon after, and the trees, missing the moisture
about their roots, many of them lost their freshness and
verdure, and some of them died.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">
<img src="images/illus187.jpg" width="515" height="669" alt="stream in woods" />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the spring reappeared in the grove, with
waters more abundant than ever, and the trees there
grew thicker and greener, and bushes and wild flowers
sprang up on every side. There, too, the birds and the
beasts, deserting the woods where they had formerly gone,
thronged to drink and rest in its shade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">Because we fear a little trouble and expense, or, it may
be, the humbling of our pride, we let those pass by our
doors who would profit us in the best things and perhaps
prove to be angels entertained unawares.</p>

<h2>THE DISTANT VIEW.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who came as a stranger into a country neighborhood
bought a cottage there which stood on rising
ground. Before his porch, and gently declining from it,
was a velvet-like green sward, and farther off a thick
growth of trees on every side. These quite surrounded
him, and gave him from his cottage door a limited but
beautiful prospect. A neighbor who came to pay him a
friendly visit, on seeing it, said:</p>

<p>“You are here in a little world of your own, with every
object that is disagreeable to look at shut out.”</p>

<p>But the man himself was not satisfied. Beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
woods, on one side, was a river, and beyond the river far-spreading
green fields. He wanted to bring these within
sight. There was no way of doing this except by cutting
down some of his trees. So, regardless of what others
might think or say, he took his axe on his shoulder one
morning, and went to the spot where the trees stood that
interrupted the desired view.</p>

<p>Upon examining them, he found they were among the
handsomest on his place. There was a chestnut already
in tassel, an elm with spreading top and fringed trunk, a
sugar-maple that he knew would turn to crimson and gold
in the autumn, and beside it a tall evergreen. But he did
not hesitate. The end to be gained would more than compensate
for his loss, and he went to work with a strong arm
and determined will, and soon laid the trees low.</p>

<p>When the distant landscape burst upon his sight, he felt
amply rewarded for the sacrifice he had made. After this
he was careful to keep the avenue which he had cleared
always open, coming down there again with his axe whenever
a young tree or a branch of an old one, or even a
bush or shrub, interfered with the view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
<img src="images/illus191.jpg" width="524" height="675" alt="man swinging axe at tree" />
</div>

<p>And now it seemed as though he never wearied of looking
at the river and the green fields beyond. Every morning,
before going to his work, he stood a few moments gazing
at them. Again, at the close of the day, on returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a><br /><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to his cottage, he looked at them in the soft sunset light.
When working in his garden or about his lawn, they were
in sight all the time. And on Sundays, or whenever he
had a few hours’ rest, he would take his favorite seat
before the door that looked out toward that view.</p>

<p>Of course there were cloudy days when the view was
interrupted, but even then he used to gaze in that direction,
knowing that the scene he loved was there. And so
he continued to do year after year. And though you may
hardly believe it when I tell you, yet it is true, that as the
years rolled on there came a changed expression upon his
face—as if he saw something which others could not see—which
never again left it.</p>

<p>After this had become so evident (though unknown to
himself) that his friends and neighbors observed it, one
of them made bold to ask him whether there was anything
more than a love of Nature that so attracted him
to the river and the green fields.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
<img src="images/illus193.jpg" width="524" height="676" alt="man in cleared field" />
</div>

<p>Then for the first time he opened his heart to another,
and said:</p>

<p>“You know, my friend, that I came to this country a
stranger, but you do not know that I came also an outcast,
disinherited justly, and banished from my Father’s
house. That house stands across yonder river, and through
all these years I have been catching glimpses of it, and hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a><br /><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
some day to return there. This reveals to you the reason
for what seems so strange in my life since I came here.
And now I know that I shall return thither. I am but a sojourner
here, and am longing to see my Father’s face—yes,
and the face of my Elder Brother, who it is that has brought
about (at His own cost) a reconciliation between us.”</p>

<h2>THE TWO VINES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN came out into his garden one spring morning to
prune his grape-vine. Wherever its branches were
growing too freely, or in a wrong direction, he cut them
off. Then he bound them to a low wooden frame he had
placed there, so that they might grow only in the direction
he intended. Now, as the day was warm and the sap was
beginning to flow, the branches bled, as the vine-dressers
say, in the places where he had pruned them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/illus196.jpg" width="516" height="672" alt="man picking grapes" />
</div>

<p>It happened that just outside of the garden wall a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a><br /><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
vine was growing, having twined itself around a tall forest-tree
that stood there. When this wild vine saw what was
done to the vine in the garden, it cried:</p>

<p>“I pity you, wounded and bleeding, and not allowed
to grow aloft, as your nature demands.”</p>

<p>“It is not because he delights in wounding me,” replied
the other, “that my master has done this. I was once a
wild vine too, but he took me up tenderly, and planted me
in his garden, and has watered and cared for me ever since.
I am willing to submit myself to his hands.”</p>

<p>Not many weeks after this rich blossoms burst forth on
both vines, giving to each an equal promise of fruit. Before
long the blossoms dropped off and the embryo fruit
appeared. As the summer advanced <i>these were tried</i>. Such
as were destined to ripen lived on through the heat and the
drought, and such as were destined to perish fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>At length autumn came. The wild vine had climbed
up to the topmost boughs of the forest-tree and was waving
its unfettered branches in the air, but on those branches
were found only a few withered grapes. But the vine in
the garden, tied down to its low frame, was loaded with
purple clusters; and the gardener came, and gathered them
into baskets, and carried them to his home. Afterward he
returned to his vine and bound straw around it, to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it from the winter’s cold. But going through the forest
with his axe in his hand, seeking for fuel, he cut down the
wild vine and cast it on the heap for the winter’s burning.</p>

<h2>THE OLD CHESTNUT AND THE YOUNG OAK.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AN old chestnut tree that had been condemned to the axe
a generation ago, being overlooked by the woodman
from year to year, still stood in its place among the trees
of the forest, and on the return of spring feebly put forth
a few leaves at the end of its branches.</p>

<p>A strong young oak that stood near, seeing this, said
to it proudly:</p>

<p>“What is such a fag-end of life worth, any way? Why
not give up the struggle and die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not for us to die when we choose,” replied the
chestnut, “but to cherish what of life is left to us.”</p>

<p>A century rolled round. The chestnut had fallen and
gone to dust, but now the oak had grown old. A yawning
cleft down its trunk showed where the lightning had blasted
it long years before. Its once mighty branches were decayed,
and broken off by winter storms; only here and
there a tuft of green remained amid the vast ruin. Viewing
these sadly one day, it said:</p>

<p>“I am made to look back a hundred years! It is my
turn now to be asked why I do not give up the struggle
and die. Ah! how little I knew what my own lot was to
be when I mocked another with the question!”</p>

<h2>CORN-CRIBS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;POOR man having died and left his widow with little
children to support, a neighbor of hers—who was
known by the name of Kris, and who was almost as poor
as herself—borrowed a horse and cart to go around among
the farmers he was acquainted with, and beg some corn
for her.</p>

<p>“All of them,” he said, “knew her husband and hired
him now and then to do day’s work; I’ll go and see what
they will give.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">
<img src="images/illus203.jpg" width="514" height="645" alt="funeral procession" />
</div>

<p>He came to the first farmer, who listened to his story
and without saying a word went to his corn-crib, filled his
bushel-measure heaping full, and emptied it into the cart.
Kris thanked him warmly for this, but the man, not seeming
to notice what he said, returned to his crib, heaped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a><br /><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the measure once more, and emptied it also into the cart.
Then for the first time he spoke, saying:</p>

<p>“I can give to so worthy an object with a clear conscience.
When she wants more, come again.”</p>

<p>As Kris drove out to the road he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I’ve made a mistake: I ought to have borrowed a
wagon instead of a cart. This will be full presently, and I
could just as easily have hauled her a two-horse load.”</p>

<p>Turning in at the next gate, he told his story to the
farmer there, who, as soon as heard it, said:</p>

<p>“Why, if a man’s got any conscience at all, he can’t
help giving to such a hard case.”</p>

<p>Saying which, he walked to his corn-crib, but with not
quite so brisk a step as the first, and filled his bushel-measure,
but not quite so full as the other, and, handing it to
Kris, let him carry it out and empty it into the cart himself.
Kris thanked him, but noticed that he did not say he was
welcome.</p>

<p>About half a mile farther on Kris came to the third
farm. As he drove in he met the farmer on the way to
his barn. He stopped and listened to what his visitor had
to say.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe,” said Kris, closing, “you’d like to
give her some corn to help her out through the winter.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
<img src="images/illus205.jpg" width="524" height="674" alt="man asking for corn" />
</div>

<p>“Of course I would,” replied the farmer. “I hate tramps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and beggars, but she’s none of them. I knew her husband
well; he gave an honest day’s work for a day’s wages. Besides,
it’s a duty to give. I’d do it to ease my conscience if
it wasn’t for anything else. Come over to the crib.”</p>

<p>Kris followed him to the door and went in. The
bushel-measure was lying there, but the man looked
around, as if something were still wanting, and then
hurried over to the stable.</p>

<p>“His big scoop is missing,” thought Kris. “He’s going
to do the best yet.”</p>

<p>In a moment he was back again carrying a peck-measure
in his hand (it looked scant even for a peck); filling
which, he handed it to Kris, who, mute with surprise,
silently emptied it into the cart.</p>

<p>From this farm Kris drove on to the one beyond. He
passed by the farmer’s house—a comfortable stone dwelling—and
turned into the barnyard. As he did so he noticed
how fat the cattle and the pigs looked. The farmer came
out to him, and Kris made his appeal.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man, “I s’pose I’ll have to help too;
and even if I didn’t want to, my conscience would make me.
But I should think such a stout-lookin’, able-bodied woman
ought to be able to help herself.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px;">
<img src="images/illus207.jpg" width="515" height="649" alt="properous man gives handful of corn" />
</div>

<p>By this time they reached the corn-crib, which Kris
noticed was full up to the very top; and the farmer, gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
up a dozen ears in his hands, pitched them into the
cart, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Whew! what a heap you’ve got there! Mind, Kris,
don’t you come for any more.”</p>

<p>Kris drove out of the gate and turned his horse’s head
toward home.</p>

<p>“The cart’s too big, after all,” he said. “It’s of no use
to go any farther; the next one would want to take away
some of what I’ve got. It’s wonderful what a crop of consciences
grows in these parts! But I’ve a notion that a
good deal of it’s only ‘cheat’ after all, and we might as
well call it by the right name.”</p>

<h2>THE OLD CLOCK IN THE NEW HOME.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CLOCK that had been handed down from generation
to generation and brought from the old country homestead
to a new city home, as it was being wound up one
day, said, impatiently:</p>

<p>“I have been running for a hundred years. Let me rest
now. Are not your fathers, whom I served so long, at
rest?”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say,” replied its master, laying aside
the key and shutting up the glass door that enclosed its
tarnished metal face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few hours the old clock was silent. Its great
leaden weights hung suspended near the floor; its broad
old-fashioned hands ceased to move, and its pendulum, no
longer flashing from right to left through the little round
pane of glass in front of it, hung motionless and still.</p>

<p>The day ended; the long night passed, and the morning
appeared. The same stirring sounds as on other mornings
were ushered in from the streets; the other clocks,
within and without, went on striking as usual. The family
rose up for the duties of the day, but as they came
down to the morning meal each member stopped on the
stairs and looked regretfully at the old clock, saying:</p>

<p>“How we miss it! How strange it seems not to hear
it going!”</p>

<p>“I lay awake last night,” said the mother, “listening
for it to strike.”</p>

<p>And so the second day passed. But toward evening, as
the master came in sight, suddenly the old clock cried
out:</p>

<p>“Come, wind me up and set me going again; and
when at last I can go no longer, take me to pieces
and sell me for old brass. For I would rather not be
at all than to exist without taking part in the busy life
that is throbbing around me.”</p>

<h2>THE GREAT SECRET.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WE keep our hearts shut up, as it were, in a safe, or
strong box, many doors deep. The first door opens
from the surface, or outside; it is like the door to the
vestibule of our house, and is open to all comers. The
second door admits to the halls and parlors, as we might
say, and is open to our acquaintances generally. The
third door gives access to the living-room of the family,
wherever that may be; it is opened to relatives and
intimate friends. The door next to this admits into the
chambers where only the nearest and dearest may come.</p>

</div>

<p>But beyond all these is another door, to which none
in the house may be likened; in this room are things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a><br /><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
may not be shown—our most secret thoughts and desires,
the best and the noblest as well as the lowest and the
basest. The door to this room is never opened to human
eyes. And yet only the eye that can see within it discerns
our true character, for here, hidden away from mortal sight,
dwells the real man; and as the outward husk and shell are
stripped off to come at the kernel and the grain, so all the
rest of us will be torn away and cast aside when the final
estimate comes to be made.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE-BUILDER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN man who owned a lot of ground determined
to build a house on it. There was a good quarry in his
lot, but to get the stone out of it required hard labor. This,
however, was all that was needed; so he went to work with
a good will, and made a prosperous beginning. First he
laid the foundation, and then several courses of the superstructure.
But the toil was severe, the wall progressed
slowly, and the work grew wearisome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 528px;">
<img src="images/illus217.jpg" width="528" height="678" alt="man with pick=axe by rocks and fence" />
</div>

<p>One day, while digging in his quarry, he discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a><br /><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
new vein of stone, which ran over his neighbor’s line, and
he picked up a block of it that came easily into his hand.
He found that it was more easily worked than his own, and
that he could almost save the labor of squaring, and dressing,
by using it. The next day he took out some more,
until he had taken enough to lay one course of it all around
the walls of his house. But this carried him so far into his
neighbor’s premises that he dared go no farther; he filled
up the opening he had made with rubbish and earth, and
went to work again on his own land. Months, and even
years, passed by; but he worked on faithfully, day by
day, and at last his house was finished. Then he furnished
it comfortably, and, taking his family with him,
moved into it, to stay there for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>Now, while his hands were busy and his mind engaged
in building, he never once thought of the course of stone
that he had taken from his neighbor. But after all was
done, and his long task completed, as he stood one day
in front of his house, admiring it, he observed that course.
It had settled into a different color from the rest—not so
different as to be noticed by others, but enough to make
it evident to himself. He found the next day, as he
passed through his garden, that he saw it again; and
after that it seemed to stand out conspicuously whenever
his face was turned toward his home. This began to annoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
him. It was only one course, to be sure; there were full
fifty courses in the wall between the roof and the foundation.
Why did this single one attract his attention before
all the rest? His conscience answered the question. It
did not rightly belong there; it never had been, and was
not now, his own.</p>

<p>A year passed from the time when his house was finished,
then another and another. It was astonishing how quickly
they sped. Yet there was not a day in all those years that
his eye did not, some time between the rising and the setting
of the sun, rest on that course of stone.</p>

<p>At length old age crept on. He had time now to sit still
and think of the past, and he did not sleep at night as he
used to. But both by day and by night the course of
stone was in his mind. Most willingly he would have
gone to his neighbor and paid him ten times its value (for
he had prospered and grown rich), but in doing so he would
have confessed himself a thief and disgraced his family for
ever; he could not do this. Or gladly he would have torn
it from his walls and placed it back in the quarry from
whence he had taken it, but that was impossible. So he
lived on, brooding over it until it drove all better and
happier thoughts out of his mind, and at last he died,
bowed down and crushed, as it were, under its weight.</p>

ever gotten dishonestly. And the worst of it is that if
it be not settled now we shall find it still standing and

<h2>PIGEONS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SOME pigeons that had their home over a rich man’s stable
came to visit a pair that lived near by in a poor
man’s barn.</p>

<p>“You’d better come and live with us,” said the rich
man’s birds, “for we not only have a beautiful new house
with partitions inside for our nests, but we’re fed every day
on the best that the farm affords.”</p>

<p>“Who feeds you?” asked the poor man’s birds.</p>

<p>“Our master’s servants, of course.”</p>

<p>“But <i>our</i> master,” replied the others, “feeds us himself.
We thank you for your invitation, but would rather stay
where we are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Summer passed and cold weather came on, and one
snowy morning the pigeons at the barn were astonished to
see their grand neighbors alight near them again.</p>

<p>“We are of the same mind still,” the poor pigeons cried,
“and can only repeat what you have heard already. We
will not go with you.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said their rich neighbors, “we have not come,
this time, to ask it, but rather to ask whether you haven’t
got a corner here in the barn where we may come and stay;
for our master has gone away for the winter, and his servants
have forgotten us, and we’re likely to starve in our
beautiful home.”</p>

<h2>THE CLOCK ON THE DESK.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;LITTLE round nickel-plated clock stood on a certain
man’s desk measuring out his hours of work. One
day, after he had been wrestling with his thoughts and
vainly endeavoring to order them to his bidding, he leaned
back in his chair, and, setting them at liberty, let them
wander whither they would.</p>

<p>In a few moments, and while he still remained in this
idle posture, he was startled at hearing from his clock,
instead of its accustomed “Tick-a-tick!” the words, “Keep
at it! Keep at it!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean those words for me?” cried the man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a><br /><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
then, before the clock had time to answer, continued: “It
is because I am resting a moment you presume thus to
rebuke me. Must a man be for ever at work? May he
not take time even to look round him, or to yawn or wait
for a new idea? Your words are insulting.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus226.jpg" width="520" height="672" alt="man with elbow on desk" />
</div>

<p>Here, being out of breath, he paused long enough for
the clock to reply:</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I said nothing. You heard only my heart
beat ‘tick-a-tick, tick-a-tick,’ as usual. When this stops,
you know as well as I that my life will be ended and my
work for you done.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the man. “Because I deserved a
rebuke, I was so quick at finding one. Though you did not
utter the words, they fit my case well. I would that you
ever might go on repeating them.”</p>

<h2>THE WATCH-DOG.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MASTIFF that had received a severe kick from his
master thus soliloquized as he walked slowly and
sadly toward his kennel:</p>

<p>“I guard his house by day and by night, securing for
him undisturbed rest, but hardly ever getting for myself so
much as an hour’s sleep at a time. He never comes near
me that I do not show my pleasure by a wag of my tail;
and when he speaks to me and pats me on the head, my
delight is so great that I can hardly control myself, and
behave as a sensible dog ought to behave. And yet,
because I happened, by accident, to be in his way, he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a><br /><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
thus ill-used and disgraced me! What a shame, when he
has the power so easily to make me happy that he abuses
it in making me miserable!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">
<img src="images/illus229.jpg" width="501" height="644" alt="large dog looking at cowering dog" />
</div>

<p>By this time the mastiff had reached his kennel, at the
farther end of the garden; but, as he was about entering
it, one of his own pups, that had been playing on the
grass with a little terrier from the next house, caught
sight of him. In a moment both the pup and the terrier
let their tails drop and slunk out of sight. The old dog
watched them as they disappeared, and after pausing a
moment said to himself:</p>

<p>“This ought not to be. The harsh treatment that I
have received makes me examine my treatment of others.
I am afraid I’m as bad as my master. It is because they
are growled at and snarled at so often these pups run
away as if their innocent gambols might cost them a
cudgelling. My master did not mean it; yet when he
kicked me, he did me a favor, for so have my own faults
been brought to my view, and from this very hour I mean
to correct them.”</p>

<h2>THE OPENED EYES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;BLIND man whose disposition had been soured by his
misfortune refused to credit anything his friends said
about the objects that surrounded him. He would not
believe that the flowers he smelt were clothed in brilliant
colors, or that the birds he heard singing were covered
with beautiful feathers. He would not believe there was
a regular succession of night and day and light and darkness.
He could give no reason for his obstinate unbelief
except that he could not imagine any of these things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which, of course, was not to be expected of him, since
he had always been blind.</p>

<p>It happened that after a time the man recovered his
sight; whatever had obscured it seemed slowly to pass
away. At first only a faint glimmer of light was visible.
This increased from day to day, until at length the last
film disappeared from before his eyes, and he looked out
upon the world and saw everything clearly.</p>

<p>Then he was like a person struck dumb and unable to
speak with wonder and astonishment. At this his friends
followed him as he walked forth unaided, and began to
explain to him what he saw.</p>

<p>“Yonder,” they said, pointing up to the sky, “is the
great sun that we have so often told you about, though
you would not believe us. But for it your eyes would
be opened in vain; you would still be in utter darkness.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">
<img src="images/illus233.jpg" width="523" height="674" alt="four men in Biblical clothes talking" />
</div>

<p>But the man, suddenly regaining his speech, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Ah, my friends! I do not need to be told this now.
Whereas all your arguments failed to convince me while
I was blind, now, though you and all the world should
tell me it was not the sun, I would know differently.
For I see him myself. He has shined into my eyes—yes,
and into my heart; and he is his own best argument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a><br /><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
How can I remain in ignorance of him while I am walking
in his light?”</p>

than all that others can say to us in its favor.</p>

<h2>THE LANTERN-PEOPLE.</h2>

</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="big">I</span> &nbsp;HAD
been thinking
how
strange a
thing it
was that I
disliked so
many people
and
liked so
few. Only to look at some persons
seemed enough to put me out of humor
and make me feel like saying cross
things. But there were others, though
not near so many of them, whom I loved
to meet and whom I could hardly be
cross to if I tried. I had been thinking about this,
when I fell asleep and had a dream.</p>

<p>I thought I was carried away to a strange
country where it was always dark. No morning
ever came there, the sun never shone, and there were no
stars in the sky. Yet people were living there, and I could
see them walking about. But they were very strange people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
such as I had never seen before, nor heard of, nor even
thought of. I called them the lantern-people because they
looked like great lanterns with lights inside of them that
shone through.</p>

<p>And they were of a very strange shape, for they had
ever so many sides, and on every side was a picture. Some
were pretty and some were ugly pictures. Every person I
saw had both pretty and ugly sides.</p>

<p>Of course I was very much surprised and stood looking
a long while, for the people could not see me though I
could see them and was close to them. On some of their
sides were pictures of snakes, wasps, and pigs; on other
sides, of doves, lambs, flowers, and such beautiful things.</p>

<p>And now I want to tell you a very curious thing about
the way the people acted when they met each other. I
noticed, when a man met another in the street, he would
quickly turn around one of his sides, so that the man he
met could see it, and nothing else—that is, nothing but
the picture that was on the side turned toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/illus237.jpg" width="395" height="492" alt="two men talking" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>While I stood watching I saw a man coming along who
turned almost the whole way around, so as to bring the
picture of a dog in front, where it could be most plainly
seen. It was a bull-dog—one of the sort that shows its
teeth—very ugly and cross-looking. I could not understand
why he should take so much trouble to turn out that
ugly picture (for he had prettier ones that I could see) until
I saw another man coming toward him, who turned out a
picture uglier still. It was of a bear.</p>

<p>As soon as they came close up to one another the pictures
seemed to be alive. I was astonished to see their eyes
move and their mouths open and shut, seeming to snap at
one another. And all I could hear were barkings and
growlings until they were gone, the dog and the bear
trying to bite each other as far as I could see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<div>
  <img class="split" src="images/illus239a.jpg" alt="two girls" width="238" height="267" />
  <img class="split" src="images/illus239b.jpg" alt="two girls" width="361" height="140" />
</div>

<p>Next came a little girl. Happening to look behind her,
she saw another little girl following her. At once she turned
round one of her sides, that had the picture of a wasp on
it. But the little girl who
was coming after her turned
out the picture of a beautiful
butterfly. As soon as they
met, the wasp began to buzz
and dart out its sharp sting,
and I saw the butterfly fluttering
and fluttering, till presently
it was scared away and
the picture of a great spider
came in its place. Then the
spider seemed to dart at
the wasp, and
the wasp tried to
sting the spider;
and the little
girls went off
quarrelling as fiercely as the two men had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Next I saw a young woman. She was prettier than any
of the lantern-people I had yet seen. I saw her coming
from a long way down the street, and she never turned
her sides, no matter whom she met, but always kept one
picture in front, and that was of a dove. It had a ring
of black around its neck and an olive-leaf in its mouth.
I thought to myself:</p>

<p>“What a beautiful picture!”</p>

<p>Just then another young woman came up and pushed
rudely against her, and I saw this rude one turn out the
picture of a snake. And the snake hissed and darted out
its forked tongue, but the dove would not go. All it did
was to coo softly and flutter with its wings and hold out
the olive-leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>When the snake found that it could not frighten the
dove away, it began to creep off itself, as if ashamed; and
what was my surprise to see, presently, another dove come
in its place! And the doves began to coo to each other,
and to look pleased and happy, and the two young women
took hold of each other’s hands; then they put their
arms around each other’s neck and kissed each other
and so they passed happily by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p>After this I walked about the streets
looking at the strange people I met there,
and, seeing a crowd of them going into a
building that had wide-open doors, I went
in with them. I found it was a church.
In a little while the minister stood up in
the pulpit and began to preach to them
about being kind to one another and loving
one another, very much as the ministers
do that we hear. I was up in the gallery, and could
see all the people as they sat listening to him. As he went
on in his sermon I saw how they turned out their good
sides, one by one, some quickly, some more slowly, until
hardly an ugly side could be seen in the whole congregation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>But no sooner was the sermon finished, and the blessing
pronounced, than there was a shifting round of sides again,
some doing this before they left their pews, some as they
passed down the aisle, some as they walked down the
church-steps; so that most of them came out pretty much
the same as they went in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/illus247.jpg" width="384" height="508" alt="two younger women following older woman out of church; all dressed very well" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>After leaving the church, I passed before a large private
house where a servant-man was standing at the door. As
he could not see me I stole by him softly and went into the
house. I found everything very elegant there. Beautiful
furniture filled the rooms, and costly paintings covered the
walls. But I soon learned that these things were not for
use or enjoyment, but only for show.</p>

<p>The family was a fashionable one that had a great deal
of company and visited a great deal. The mother, a tall,
fine-looking woman, was evidently the ruling spirit among
them. Whenever she and her daughters were getting
ready for a walk, or a drive, she turned out the picture of
a large peacock, and her daughters turned out little peacocks.
I followed them into the street, and as they walked
along could see the people bowing and smiling to them;
but as soon as they had passed, these same people made
fun of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<div>
  <img class="splitr" src="images/illus249a.jpg" alt="family at dinner" width="398" height="369" />
  <img class="splitr" src="images/illus249b.jpg" alt="family at dinner" width="201" height="55" />
</div>


<p>In a second house that I
entered the family was seated
at dinner. Though not so fine a house as the first, nor
so expensively furnished, I could tell at a glance it was a
far happier home. I looked round to see if I could discover
the cause of this difference, and here again my eye
rested on the mother, who sat at the head of the table;
but what a contrast with the other! The dove was on
her breast, and a brood of doves on the breasts of the
little ones who were gathered around her. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
cheerful, innocent talk in which all took part, without a
word of unkindness for any one, present or absent.</p>

<p>I stayed about this house for the rest of the day—it
was a pleasant place to be in—and when, toward its close,
the mother stole apart to a little room alone, I peeped in
and saw there a chair, and a table with an open book on it,
and a kneeling-cushion, well used, on the floor beside the
table. Then I said to myself:</p>

<p>“Perhaps here is the secret of the difference between
this and the more elegant home.”</p>

<p>I cannot close this account of what I saw while I was
in that strange country without telling of a difference that
I noticed between the old and the young people there.
The young were constantly changing their sides; the old
did not change them nearly so often. It appeared that if
they had turned out their ugly sides for the most part
during their former lives, they lost the power, as they grew
old, to draw them back again. On the other hand, if they
had struggled against the bad and kept out the good, the
good became fixed there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/illus251.jpg" width="340" height="540" alt="woman praying alone in alcove flying birds in foreground" />
</div>

<p>My dream seemed to last a long time, and I visited a
great many places and saw a great many persons that I
have not told about here. But this I noticed everywhere
I went—that those who kept out their good sides had the
best time of it. They were contented and cheerful themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and helped to make others so. The doves, as we
have read, brought out other doves, and the flowers brought
out other flowers. Whoever turned out these saw them
turned out by other people also. And so, with a pleasant
prospect without and a kindly spirit within, the good-sided
people experienced a happiness which the ugly-sided people
never knew.</p>

<h2>FAIR AND FOUL WEATHER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SHOWER having come up suddenly while the
chickens were scattered over the barnyard, they
ran from every direction to the chicken-house and disappeared,
one by one, through a hole near the ground
that had been left open for them to enter.</p>

<p>A young cock, however, that happened to be in an
adjoining field, took refuge under a tree, where he
straightened himself up, letting his tail droop, so that
the water would trickle off from it. But when he found
that the shower did not pass over, as he expected, he too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
took to his heels and joined the rest under shelter. And
there they all stood, chickens, ducks, and guinea-fowls,
dolefully watching the rain.</p>

<p>After waiting for a time, and finding it likely to continue,
the cock, shaking out his feathers, said:</p>

<p>“I’m going out to hunt for my dinner.”</p>

<p>“What! in such a pour as this?” exclaimed an old hen.</p>

<p>“And what would you have us do?” replied the cock.
“We cannot carry umbrellas, like our master and mistress.
And, for all we know, it may rain the rest of the week.”
So saying, he walked boldly out into the shower.</p>

<p>Now, the wet having brought the worms to the surface,
he soon picked up a good meal; which the others descrying,
they quickly came after him, until the whole flock was
scratching about the barnyard, quite contented notwithstanding
the rain. Seeing this, the rooster flew up on
a fence and crowed. Then, looking slyly at the old hen
that had opposed him, he said:</p>

<p>“Which is best—to work only in fair weather, or to
keep on scratching whether it rain or shine?”</p>

<h2>WRECKAGE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO men were walking along the sea-beach together.
The sand, as far as the eye could reach, was swept
clean and smooth by the falling tide, but here and there
at intervals lay fragments of wrecked vessels, some made
of heavy timber, some of lighter weight. Now, the men,
who were both of them well on in years, lived in a port
near by on that same coast, and as they walked they
recognized some of these wrecks.</p>

<p>“I remember the night when this came ashore,” said
one, stopping before a huge piece of keel half buried in
the sand. “She was a fine ship, well manned, and the
bar on which she struck was laid down plainly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a><br /><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
chart; but her master thought he could come close in,
and yet just miss it. But the current caught him, and
he was lost.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/illus259.jpg" width="509" height="667" alt="ship in top scene; two men talking on shore in middle scene;shadow of ship in bottom scene" />
</div>

<p>Then, stopping before another fragment:</p>

<p>“And I recollect this one too: she was a stanch bark,
and I saw her heaving up her anchor on a fine morning
with the promise of a prosperous voyage; but she tried
to go out without a pilot, and she too came ashore. Ah,
my friend!” the speaker continued. “As I look up and
down this coast, and see so many wrecks whose history
I know, a gloom settles over me that makes life seem, as
I look back on it, more like a time of clouds and storms
than of pleasant, sunny weather.”</p>

<p>“There are wrecks enough to sadden us, that is true,”
replied the other; “but do not let us forget the good ships
we have known that sailed the seas for many a long year,
and at last came back to lay their old bones down in quiet
waters on the flats behind our harbor. Yes, and many
another is still ploughing the deep, to return safe in due
time, bringing joyful crews and rich cargoes with them.”</p>

<h2>THE ROBIN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;POOR widow who was all alone in the world earned
her living by going out to wash and scrub, day
after day. She left her room early in the morning, and
did not return to it until night. Then she had but one
living thing to keep her company, a pet robin. That it
might catch a glimpse of the blue sky, from the narrow
alley in which she lived, she used to hang it on a nail
quite outside of her window, before she left. On her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
return she took it down and suspended it again near the
head of her bed.</p>

<p>One evening on coming home she found the cage with
its door open, and empty. After searching again and
again, through every corner and cranny of her room,
thinking her bird could not have left her, she was forced
to admit it was gone.</p>

<p>Now, those who are surrounded with objects on which
to bestow their affections, know not what a loss such an
insignificant creature may be to one who has no other
familiar thing to love. The poor woman missed her bird
when she awoke in the morning, when she went out to
her day’s work, and when she came back, tired and sad
at heart, after her work was over. The cage still hung
near her bed; she looked at it and grieved—yes, more
than she ought to have done.</p>

<p>While it was thus with her she had, one night, a dream.
She thought she was walking through a forest. The air
was pure, the shade was cool and delightful, and every
leaf around her looked fresh and green. She stood comparing
the scene, in her thoughts, with the crowded alley
in which she lived, when suddenly the silence was broken
by a loud note far above her head. She looked up, and
recognized her robin. It was leaping from bough to
bough, and its song was not as it used to be, with a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a><br /><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of sadness in it, but glad and full of joy—the song of the
prisoner set free.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus263.jpg" width="520" height="664" alt="woman by birdcage; woman walking in woods" />
</div>

<p>She awoke, rose up, took down the cage and put it in
a closet out of sight, not forgetting its former inmate, but
thinking of it as she had seen it, since its escape, in her
dream.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied,” she said, “and would not call it back.
Its prison door has been opened; I will wait patiently until
mine is opened for me.”</p>

<h2>RIDDLES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE ground was barren and wet, and covered with
stagnant pools. Only rank weeds grew on it, and
venomous reptiles crawled through it. But at length the
husbandman came and labored over it. He dug trenches
and ditches that drained it, and turned a stream of pure
water to flow through it. Then he hedged it, and set up
a fence around it; and now flocks pasture there, and
flowers bloom on every side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;GARDENER planted some seed in his garden in the
early spring, but no sooner had it grown up than the
frost nipped it. It sprang up a second time, and a bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
flew down and plucked off the tender shoot. Once more
it grew, but now, summer having come, the sun scorched
it. Nevertheless, because the root remained, it sprang up
again and again, until the gardener, rejoicing, gathered in
his fruit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MOUNTAIN-STREAM ran over the edge of a precipice.
In its descent to the valley below it fell upon a
point of projecting rock. On this rock clods of earth were
continually dropping from the ground it was imbedded in.
Sometimes they fell of their own weight, sometimes were
loosened by the foot of a wild beast in passing. There
was never a day that the rock was not soiled by them.
But the stream, in flowing over it, washed away each
stain as soon as it appeared; so that to the eye looking
from above, it seemed always pure and clean.</p>

<h2>THE EMIGRANT’S WAGON.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AN emigrant who started in a new wagon for his far-off
Western home seemed to forget, because the wagon
was new and strong then, that it would ever wear out. As
a consequence, he was very careless in his way of using
it, driving as fast down hill as up, and over rough places
as smooth. Sometimes he raced with other wagons, and
occasionally loaded his own so heavily and drove so recklessly,
it was upset.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
<img src="images/illus269.jpg" width="508" height="666" alt="overloaded wagon in top scene, wagon racing in bottom scene" />
</div>

<p>In spite of all this ill-usage, however, the wagon seemed
to remain almost as good as new until it had travelled over
about half of its journey, when it began to show the effects
of abuse. First some rivets broke, leaving the floor-boards
loose; next a spoke in one of the wheels began to rattle;
then a tire rolled off. After this, one breakage followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a><br /><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
another so rapidly that its owner was often forced to stop
for repairs. Neither could he always make these by himself,
but was obliged to call on the blacksmith and the
wheelwright to help him. As he waited at their shops
day after day he could not help thinking of his past
folly, and saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Oh that I had the first part of the road to go over
again!”</p>

<p>But, as this was impossible, it only remained for him to
use the utmost care while passing over the portion that
was left.</p>

<p>And so he did, creeping along slowly, avoiding every
little jolt and rut by the way, and often turning out to let
others, who had started after him, pass by. For the farther
he went, the weaker his wagon grew, until it fell into such
a decrepit state that it was threatening all the time to break
down under him, and travelling in it, instead of being a
pleasure, as it was at first, became only labor and pain.</p>

<p>But at last, though in miserable plight, he came to his
journey’s end. It is true that his wagon could not have
remained new until then, no matter what care he had taken
of it; on the contrary, it must have been well worn, and
old, beside, for it had come a great distance and been a
long time in doing it. But if he had used it properly, and
as a wagon ought to be used, from the start, without doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a><br /><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
it would have carried him all the way safely and comfortably.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/illus271.jpg" width="512" height="665" alt="wagon looking worse and worse in two travel scenes" />
</div>

<p>And then what a different account of his coming would
have been written! For, in the first place, he could have
given the time to pleasanter things that, as it was, he had
to spend in patching up his wagon. Then he could have
occasionally helped some poorer and more heavily-loaded
emigrant that he came up with along the road. And
lastly (beside escaping numerous bruises and pains) he
would have been saved many poignant regrets and recollections,
which added greatly to the burdens he had to
bear during the latter part of his journey.</p>

<h2>BIG AND LITTLE LANTERNS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO countrymen who were neighbors started out on a
dark night for the nearest market-town, each carrying
a basket of butter and eggs and garden-produce on his arm.
They took different roads, which were, however, of about
equal lengths. One of the men—the taller and stronger
of the two—carried a large and heavy lantern on a pole
high above his head, by means of which he was enabled
to see far over the road in front of him; and he set out
with long and rapid strides.</p>

<p>The other man carried a light and small lantern, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
he held down close to the ground, by his side, so that he
could see no farther than the spot on which to plant his
foot, as he moved on more slowly and cautiously, step by
step.</p>

<p>Some time during the night the latter reached his destination
and quickly sold out his basketful of produce to
the early risers of the town; but afterward, on looking
around for his neighbor, was surprised to learn that he
had not yet appeared. He waited a while, and then,
fearing the man had met with some disaster—for the two
were friends—started back to find him; and about midway
of the road he found him, sure enough, fallen down into
a pit that he had not seen, because, instead of looking
well to the ground that was close around him, he was,
by means of his great lantern, gazing far ahead.</p>

<p>But, though he could not get out, happily none of his
bones were broken; and when his friend had torn a rail
from a fence near by and thrown it to him, he managed
to clamber up the side and escape from his trap. Yet his
butter and eggs were spoiled and his lantern damaged,
and, as he was badly bruised by the fall, he begged his
neighbor to remain with him, saying:</p>

<p>“There is nothing left for me but, by your help, to
hobble back to where I started from as best I can.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">
<img src="images/illus275.jpg" width="523" height="669" alt="two men walking separately" />

<p>And so it came to pass that he who was the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a><br /><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
furnished and more confident at the start, came out a
good deal worse off at the end.</p>

<h2>THE CAT AND THE TIGER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CAT that was a pet in a farmer’s family, understanding
from the talk of the children that a show of wild
animals had come to the neighboring village, stole off one
morning to see it, and, creeping in under the edge of the
great canvas tent, proceeded to walk around the ring and
look in at the cages.</p>

<p>She had not gone far when she came opposite to the
tiger’s cage, and, looking up, saw there a creature of her
own species so powerful, so immense, and withal so beautifully
marked, that she was lost in admiration and felt
almost ready to bow down and worship it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great king of our race,” she cried, “I admire, and am
willing to obey you!”</p>

<p>But the tiger, insensible to her praise, replied with contempt:</p>

<p>“You poor little mouse-eating creature, do you come here
to claim relationship with one so great and strong as I am?”</p>

<p>At this the cat, quickly regaining her composure,
answered:</p>

<p>“If your strength is so great that it must be restrained,
and causes you to be shut up where it is only a torment to
you as you walk up and down before the bars of your cage,
then I would rather be as I am, weak and little, but suited to
my place in the farmer’s kitchen.”</p>

<h2>CHARITY.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN rich man appointed an hour when the poor
people of his city had permission to call at his house
and ask for charity. When the hour arrived, the man sat
in his parlor, while his servant stood at the door to question
those who called and report what they said to his
master.</p>

<p>The first one who came was a day-laborer. He was
willing to dig or to carry, or to work at anything he could
find, but he could find nothing. To him the rich man
sent a piece of silver.</p>

<p>The second one was a sailor. Only a few weeks before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
he had sailed, full of hope, out of the harbor; but his ship
was wrecked in a storm, and he saved only the clothes that
covered him. To him also was sent a piece of silver.</p>

<p>The one who came next had seen better days; he had
owned the little house he lived in, with enough out at
interest beside to keep the wolf from its door. But misfortune
had robbed him of all, and now he was in want.
To him were sent two silver pieces.</p>

<p>After him came a mechanic who long ago had worked
for the rich man’s father, and helped to build the beautiful
house that his father once lived in. To him the rich man
sent a piece of gold.</p>

<p>Then came an old man who was still erect and vigorous,
but with silvery locks and flowing beard. In his younger
days he had been a merchant. He well remembered the
rich man’s father when he was a merchant too, and told
of his honor and influence, and spoke feelingly of the
favors he had often done him. To him the rich man
sent two golden pieces.</p>

<p>When the next person called, the servant came in and
told his master that this one seemed to be the most needy
of all. He was bowed down with age and leaning upon a
staff, and had travelled a long and weary journey from the
place where the rich man’s father was born, and used to
live before he came to the city and made his fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your master’s father and I were boys together,” he
said, “and, in truth, I was a near relation to him, and so
I am to your master. But sickness and misfortune have
left me without bread to eat, or a place to lay my
head.”</p>

<p>But when the rich man heard this sad story, he looked
at his watch, saying:</p>

<p>“The hour is past that I appointed to listen to the
poor. Go tell the man he is too late; and when he is
gone, shut the door, and bolt it after him.”</p>

<h2>THE DAY-LABORERS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;certain land-owner called two of his hired servants
early in the morning and sent them out to work in
his field. On the way there one of them said to himself:</p>

<p>“Though I do not care for my master, I care for the
wages he will pay me; therefore I will do a good day’s
work, not for him, but for myself.”</p>

<p>But the other man said:</p>

<p>“Though I take wages, my master’s profit is dearer to
me than my own; therefore the work that I do is not so
much for myself as for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>So the men went out into the field to do their master’s
bidding. And while they labored there the sun rose up
high above them, and his fierce rays beat down on their
heads. Yet they did not rest from their labors, but toiled
on until he passed through the heavens and began slowly
to descend again. And in the evening, after he had sunk
below the horizon, they came and stood before their master
to give account of the day.</p>

<p>The first one said:</p>

<p>“I have ploughed deep in your field and cast out the
heavy stones that were buried there.”</p>

<p>The second one said:</p>

<p>“I have gathered up the stones, and carried them to the
edge of the field, and set up a strong fence around it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>And as the master looked at their soiled and toil-worn
garments and their sunburned arms and hands, he knew
that what they told him was true. But when he looked
in their faces, on one was the expression of coldness and
on the other was the expression of love. Then he gave
to each of them his wages, but the one who loved him
he called into his house, to be with him and wait on him
continually.</p>

<h2>THE ARTIST’S ANSWER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who had accompanied an artist around his studio,
admiring his pictures, exclaimed,</p>

<p>“What an easy and privileged life is yours, calling forth
and putting into visible shape such beautiful forms from day
to day! You give delight to others, it is true, but surely
the largest share must remain for yourself.”</p>

<p>Said the artist,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“Name to me some object in nature that you admire.”</p>

<p>“This rose,” replied the other, “which you have placed
as a model on your table.”</p>

<p>“We will take that,” said the artist. “Now, what is its
history? First, the parent slip was laid in the ground, and
at once began its struggle for life. It put forth tender roots,
doubtful of the result, but the soil received them kindly,
and it lived. Then the tiny stalk appeared above, and at
length an embryo bud. But suppose the sun had scorched
this bud or the storm destroyed it? They destroyed many
another, yet it was spared, and at last opened in full bloom
as you see it here.</p>

<p>“Now, if the plant that bore it could speak, what would
it say? Something like this: ‘The rose you admire did not
spring up uncalled, like a beautiful thought, but is the result
of slow development. I could not but labor to bring it
forth, for such was the work appointed me. But the throes
of effort were needed, and, now that it is perfected, my delight
is not in looking at it as a brilliant flower, but as the
fruit of my labor, hoping it may fill its place among beautiful
things and accomplish that for which it was called into
being.’</p>

<p>“So, my friend,” continued the artist, turning to his
companion, “if you think that these pictured forms which
you delight in were of easy creation, springing up spontaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
like a passing emotion, you have in what the flowers
says my answer.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">Each beautiful work costs labor, but how much only he
knows whose hands have formed it.</p>

<h2>THE HEMLOCK AND THE SUGAR-MAPLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SUGAR-MAPLE tree and a hemlock grew close
together, high up on the side of a mountain. All
summer they were, alike, covered with green, so that they
could hardly be distinguished one from the other. But as
autumn approached, the maple put on gayer colors. Branch
after branch changed to orange, and crimson, and gold, until
the whole tree seemed to be robed in these gorgeous tints.
Seeing this, the hemlock said discontentedly to its neighbor:</p>

<p>“Why am I not beautiful like you? While your
branches are growing brighter every day, mine do not
change at all, unless it be to a duller hue. I am tired
of this stale, old-fashioned green.”</p>

<p>But the maple made no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>A little while after this there was a change in the
weather. Heavy gray clouds covered the sky. A cold
rain came on, and the sun was not seen for several days.
And now the leaves of the maple began to wither and lose
their bright hues, and as the gusts of wind shook them
they fell in showers from the branches. Then the maple,
looking down upon them, said to the hemlock:</p>

<p>“You envied my beauty, but where is it now? See
the remains of it lying scattered over the ground! My
branches are being left bare for the long winter’s cold,
while yours are still clothed with their thick, warm
foliage.”</p>

<h2>BREAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who was strolling through the country for his
own enjoyment came to the top of a hill, where he
stopped to admire the view. While he was standing there
a laborer with pick and shovel on his shoulder and dinner-basket
on his arm passed by. The man spoke to him and
the laborer answered civilly, but, hurrying on, was soon out
of sight.</p>

<p>After viewing the prospect from the hilltop, the man
proceeded on his way until he came to a waterfall on the
edge of a wood. Here he rested for a good while watching
the stream break into foam and spray as it flowed over the
rocks into the deep basin below.</p>

<p>From here he proceeded along the lonely road, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
what beautiful object would next appear, when presently
he saw, spread out before him, a lake of blue water
with bushes and wild flowers growing around its edge.
It was almost noon by the time he was satisfied with
gazing on this charming scene.</p>

<p>Then he started on his ramble again, but had not gone
far when he spied the laborer who passed him earlier in
the day, digging away with his pick and shovel in a
rocky field beside the road. Leaning against the fence,
the pleasure-seeker stopped, and said:</p>

<p>“Rather hard work grubbing at these stones?”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied the laborer, “but nothing else
will bring them out of the ground.”</p>

<p>“This is a pleasant country to look at,” continued the
other, “but not to make your living out of, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“You’d say so if you tried it. I suppose you’re a
stranger about here?”</p>

<p>“Yes; this is my first visit, and I’m just sauntering
along feasting on the beautiful view. You people who
live in the country don’t half appreciate its charms.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">

</div>

<p>Here the laborer, looking up at the sky and seeing the
sun just over his shoulder, dropped his shovel, and, going
to a shady spot beside a spring, where he had deposited
his dinner-basket, opened it and began to eat. His new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a><br /><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
acquaintance looked on until he had seen slice after slice
of bread and meat emerge from the clean white napkin
and disappear, when he said:</p>

<p>“My friend, would you mind sparing me a bit? This
walk has made me hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” replied the laborer, “you’ve been feasting
on the view all the morning, while I’ve been grubbing
at the stones. If I give you my dinner, then you’ll have
two feasts, and I’ll have none.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">If we cultivate our taste for the beautiful, to the neglect

themselves this luxury, to supply our needs when we come

<h2>THE HARPER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HARPER stood before the door of a house and played
a number of tunes without seeming to attract the
attention of any one within until he played a sad and
plaintive air, when an upper window opened and a hand
reached out and dropped a coin into the hat that he held
beneath.</p>

<p>From this house he went to another, and played the
same air; but no notice was taken of him until he changed
from it to a more cheerful tune, when a piece of money was
again thrown to him.</p>

<p>After this he was careful to note down in a little book
that he carried what sort of music pleased the inmates of
the different houses in his round; and whenever he selected
a new tune, it was always with some special hearers in view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to whom he went and played it as soon as it was learned.
In this way he was kept busy from day to day, and by
means of his harp earned a good living.</p>

<p>Now, although he played a variety of tunes to please
many different hearers, he had strong preferences of his
own. There were a few of his pieces that he loved
better than all the rest, and at the houses where these
were played his music was at its best, because he played
it out of his heart.</p>

<p>So, one day, as he was trudging along with his harp on
his back, he said to himself:</p>

<p>“A portion of my work is a joy and delight to me, but
the rest is labor and toil. Why should I not play that
music only that I love, and to those alone who can
appreciate it? In it lies not only my chief pleasure, but
my real power as well. I am resolved henceforth to adopt
this plan.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/illus303.jpg" width="493" height="651" alt="man playing full sized harp on street" />
</div>

<p>So he gave up all but the few tunes in which he himself
delighted, and played only at the houses where these
had been enjoyed. But in a little while he noticed that he
was not welcomed at these houses as he used to be, and
the cause (though he was loath to acknowledge it) was not
hidden from him. His favorite airs, by their sameness and
constant repetition, had ceased to stir his own heart as
they once did; hence his music had lost its fervor, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a><br /><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
this its power over the hearts of others. Then he said to
himself:</p>

<p>“The plan which necessity imposed on me was better
than my own. Its discords tended to heighten its harmonies.
Experience having taught me this, I will now
return to that plan.”</p>

<p>So he took up all his old pieces, practising them over
again, and playing them, as he used to do, from door to
door. And in thus doing (mingling the bitter with the
sweet) he soon prospered again.</p>

<h2>THE UNAPPRECIATED GIFT.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HUSBANDMAN was at work in his field, earning his
living by the sweat of his brow, when there came a
man carrying a young tree in his hand, which he planted
at one side of the field, saying:</p>

<p>“Give this the space that it needs, let it spread and
grow, and wait patiently: in due time its fruit and shade
will repay you;” having said which, he departed.</p>

<p>The husbandman heard the man’s words, but went on
with his labor from day to day without much regarding
them. The tree remained where it had been planted, putting
out new branches and growing higher and stronger.</p>

<p>But after a time strange doubts and suspicions concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the tree entered the husbandman’s mind. As it took up
more ground, he looked on it grudgingly, and said to himself:</p>

<p>“This is not a fruit tree at all, but a thorn. If I let it
stand, it will send up its evil shoots all over my field.”</p>

<p>Then, taking his axe in his hand, at one stroke he
severed the stalk from the roots.</p>

<p>After this the seasons came and went as they ever had
done. The husbandman sowed in the spring and reaped
in the harvest. And so he continued to do from year to
year, until his labors began to tell upon his strength,
and he felt stealing upon him the infirmities of an old
man. His field still yielded its crop, but was bare and
sunny, without a sheltered spot in which he could sit
down and rest.</p>

<p>It happened one day after hours of toil that he sank
exhausted, and slept even under the burning rays of the
sun. In his sleep he dreamed that he was sitting in the
shade. Over him green branches were spread. They
were loaded with fruit, which hung so near the ground
that he put forth his hand as he sat, and plucked and
ate. Birds were also singing in the branches, and a
cool breeze passed through them, fanning his brow.
He said:</p>

<p>“Surely these have been growing, and their shadows
deepening, to cover my head and refresh me in my old age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke suddenly the man who had long ago
appeared to him again stood before him, saying:</p>

<p>“Such would have been the tree that I planted on this
spot had you not, in unbelief and self-will, cut it down.”</p>

<p>The husbandman awoke from his sleep and found it was
only a dream, and that he was still lying alone and unsheltered
under the burning rays of the sun.</p>

<h2>THE WORN-OUT TEAM.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO horses, a bay and a gray, were bred on the same
farm. Being nearly of an age and about equal in
size, they were mated in harness, and, working well
together, were kept as a pair. They went to the plough,
the harrow, and the hay-wagon season after season. In
this close companionship there grew up something of an
attachment between them, although they differed in disposition.
The gray was patient and uncomplaining, while
the bay, though quite as good a worker, was not of so
good a temper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/illus311.jpg" width="458" height="564" alt="barnyard scene" />
</div>

<p>The seasons came and went. In the spring they toiled
together turning up the heavy sod, in the autumn hauling
in great loads of hay and grain, until at length, as years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a><br /><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
passed by, their bulky forms began to shrink and ribs and
thigh-bones to appear. More than this, the gray lifted one
hind leg higher than formerly, giving a hint of the string-halt,
and the bay panted so violently after a short journey
as to suggest a thought of the heaves. But they had done
their share of work, and the farmer was not the man to
sell them off now to some hard fate: they were allowed
to stand in the stable or given lighter tasks, while a pair
of young horses, that had come on in the mean while,
were put to the heavy work about the farm.</p>

<p>One summer day, while the old horses were resting in
their stalls, the hay-wagon came in with a load from the
field. As it drew near the barn the farmer’s son shouted
to encourage his young team up the rise that led on to the
barn-floor, and the old pair heard them, as they entered,
pounding overhead.</p>

<p>“That is what we used to do,” said the bay, “until they
put the colts in our place.”</p>

<p>“We never thought then of getting old and past work,”
said the gray.</p>

<p>“But we’ve come to it now.”</p>

<p>“Many a heavy load have we hauled up that rise before
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think of it often,” said the bay, “and of something
else too: I think of that hard hill over across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
bridge. I was not always good to you when we were
climbing up that.”</p>

<p>“You always pulled your full share, though.”</p>

<p>“But I needn’t have put back my ears and snapped at
you angrily every few steps.”</p>

<p>“Let that go; think no more of it,” said the gray.</p>

<p>“And not only the hill do I remember,” continued the
bay, “but many a hot day on the road, while you were
doing your best, I jerked in the harness and jeered at you
because my nose happened to be a few inches ahead.”</p>

<p>“Think of the pleasant trots we had together, instead,”
persisted the gray—“the gambols in the clover-field, and
the rolls in the sand down beside the creek. As for the
rest, they’re past and forgiven; let them be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“You may forgive them,” said the bay, “but I can’t
forgive them myself. And now, while I stand here by
your side, both of us grown old, they come back and
worry me—yes, more than ever the heavy loads did, or
even the driver’s whip.”</p>

<h2>THE WISE FARMER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FARMER came into possession of some new land. It
consisted of three fields that lay adjoining each other,
but on going to examine them he was astonished at the
difference in their quality. The first was stony ground;
the next, though not stony, was of a thin and light soil;
while the third, lying lower and being meadow-land, was
covered with rich, dark loam. As a whole, the ground
was not what he had expected, and in his disappointment
he hardly knew what to do. But after consulting with his
wife, who was a prudent adviser, he concluded to do his
best with all three fields, and not, on account of its inferior
quality, to neglect either one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">
<img src="images/illus315.jpg" width="526" height="670" alt="farmer working in three scenes" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The stony field was hard to cultivate. The ploughing
was laborious, and so were all the other processes of farming
it. Yet he persevered till it was well seeded down with
grass and clover. The middle field—the one with the thin
light soil—required a great deal of help. He had to spend
largely for different kinds of fertilizers, and afterward was
at much trouble in clearing the ground to receive them.
But by hard work he got this field also planted with oats
in good time.</p>

<p>The rich loamy field, which from the start he had
longed to begin on, was left, purposely, till the last.
As he took down the bars and drove his team into it day
after day he chuckled to himself, saying: “I do love to
farm this field!”</p>

<p>It required but half the expense and labor to make it
ready that either of the others required, and no sooner had
he drilled in the wheat than there came a shower that made
it spring up, so that he could almost see it growing.</p>

<p>The planting being done, he waited patiently for the
harvest. Then the stony field yielded him a good crop
of hay, which he got safely into his barn without a single
wetting; the field with the thin light soil gave a fair crop
of oats—enough to feed his stock during the winter; and
the rich loamy ground yielded a splendid crop of wheat—sufficient
not only to furnish his family with flour, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a><br /><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to let him sell a portion, that brought in enough money
for all his other needs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus317.jpg" width="530" height="674" alt="farmer by horses talking to wife and baby" />
</div>

<p>“How much better are we off,” he said to his wife one
day after the harvesting was over, “that we took the land
willingly, just as it came to us, instead of finding fault with
it and neglecting the poorer fields because they did not
equal our expectations! And, now that we have got them
so well started, we may expect them, with proper care, to
go on improving from year to year.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">Among those who come under our care (our own children,
it may be) we shall find some less answerable to our

performing it we shall not only do justice to them, but
secure a recompense, in the end, to ourselves.</p>

<h2>WAYFARERS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who had an ugly limp in his gait, but was nevertheless
a good walker, sat down on a bench by the
wayside one day, saying, impatiently:</p>

<p>“This lameness embitters my life. I cannot for a
moment lose sight of it. I go limping along, my legs are
unlike, my steps are uneven, and, though I do not suffer
positive pain, I very often experience discomfort. Beside all
this, I fear, as I grow older, my halt will increase upon me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
so that I shall be even more of a cripple then than I am
now. How I wish I could change places with yonder
cheerful-looking man who is coming this way with such
an even, measured tread!”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking the man he referred to suddenly
turned toward the bench on which the speaker was resting
and took a seat at his side, but rather closer than was
needful, as they two had it alone.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said the new comer as he felt himself
crowding his neighbor; “I am blind, and, although I
know this path so well that I can walk along it without a
guide, I could not see that another was seated here before
me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” said the lame man, feelingly.
“Surely, no one would suspect you were blind from your
firm step and your cheerful countenance. May I ask how
it is you preserve so happy an aspect under so great a misfortune?”</p>

<p>“By looking at what I have, and not at what I have
lost,” replied the blind man. “Though I cannot see, I can
hear the voice of my friends, the sound of music, the singing
of birds. I can taste three good meals, and enjoy
them, every day. I can smell a rose in bloom farther
than you can, for all my senses that remain are keener
for the absence of the one that is gone. My health, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a><br /><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
is good, and I have learned to work so skilfully at basket-making
that, with a little I have beside, I am able to pay
my own way without being a burden to others. Thus, in
the apportioning of my lot, so much more has been given
than taken, that I consider life’s bargain a good one for
me.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the blind man, after a few moments’
rest, bade his new acquaintance “Good-bye,” and, rising
from the bench, felt his way cautiously, counting each
step, until he reached the middle of the sidewalk, when
he wheeled around and proceeded on his way with the
same measured tread that had first attracted his companion’s
attention. As he disappeared the latter said:</p>

<p>“What is my limp, which still permits me to walk
wherever I will, to his blindness, which shuts out every
ray of light? Yet he is the happier of the two! After
all, blind as he is, I was doing myself no unkindness in
wishing I could take his place.”</p>

<h2>OTHER BIRDS’ FEATHERS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;GANDER and a cock lived on the same farm. They
were young and handsome birds, each well satisfied
with himself, but, unfortunately, jealous of the other. This
made them always ready to pick a quarrel. Chancing one
day to meet beside a brook that ran by the farmhouse, the
cock straightened himself up and said:</p>

<p>“Look at my long and graceful tail-feathers, and compare
them with the short stubby quills in your tail.”</p>

<p>To which the gander replied:</p>

<p>“Look at the soft white down on my breast, and compare
it with the frowsy black stubble on yours.”</p>

<p>“I can crow,” said the cock, “but you can’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can swim,” said the gander, “and you can’t.”</p>

<p>“I can!” “I can!” cried both birds in a rage; and with
that the cock jumped into the water and nearly drowned
himself in attempting to swim, and the gander strutted up
and down trying to crow.</p>

<p>Just then a goose, with her brood of goslings passing
by, looked at them, and said:</p>

<p>“My children, take warning from these two fools. Be
content, when you grow up, to wear your own feathers,
and to let other birds wear theirs.”</p>

<h2>THE NIGHT-WATCHMAN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN man who prided himself upon his infidel
opinions desired to employ a watchman around his
house during the night. This it was no more than prudent
for him to do, as he was very rich, keeping up an expensive
establishment and known often to have a large amount of
money about his person.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 527px;">
<img src="images/illus327.jpg" width="527" height="681" alt="four men talking in room in top scene; two men sitting under trees in bottom scene" />
</div>

<p>Many came to apply for the position he wanted filled,
some of whom he dismissed at a glance, some after a brief
interview; but others appeared well qualified for the place.
Of these, three came equally well recommended, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a><br /><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
determined to make his choice from among them. He
therefore took them apart separately, and after inquiring
more particularly into their former occupations and history
wrote down the places of their residence, and also,
without letting them know it, a careful description of their
dress and appearance. As soon as they were gone he
called three of his servants to him and said:</p>

<p>“You know I am looking for a man as night-watchman;
I think he can be found among those who have just left,
and I want you to assist me in making a selection. To-morrow
will be Sunday. Be up, all of you, bright and
early, and one go and stand near the lodging-place of
each of these men. Watch them when they come out
in the morning, keep near them all day, and come here
at night and report what you have seen.”</p>

<p>The servants, promising obedience, retired, and the next
night, according to orders, returned to their master.</p>

<p>“And what have you to tell about your man?” he said
to the first who appeared.</p>

<p>“He spent the day in the country,” replied the servant.</p>

<p>“Sensible fellow!” said his master. “And did you go
with him?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did—got off at the same station, took dinner
at the same table, and came back in the same train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>“And how did he behave himself?”</p>

<p>“Like a sensible fellow, sir, as you called him. He had a
friend with him, and they just smoked their cigars and lay
about in the shade all day; took a glass of beer now and
then—nothing more. I believe he’s the very man that
would suit you.” Here the second servant came in.</p>

<p>“And what have you to say?” asked his master.</p>

<p>“My man,” replied the servant, “went to the tavern.”</p>

<p>“He’s none the worse for that, if he didn’t take too
much after he got there.”</p>

<p>“And he didn’t; only three glasses—I counted them—between
breakfast and dinner.”</p>

<p>“Little enough!”</p>

<p>“You’d have thought so if you had only seen how his
friends pressed him, a dozen times, to take more.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t make him. He’s just the man for a
watchman, I’m sure.” The third servant now appeared.</p>

<p>“And where did your man go?” asked his master.</p>

<p>“To church,” replied the servant.</p>

<p>“Did you follow him?”</p>

<p>“You told me to, and I did, and sat in the pew right
behind him.” At this the other men laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, did he gape around at his neighbors, and then
fall asleep, like the rest of the hypocrites who go there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; I must tell you the truth.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it, then.”</p>

<p>“I watched him and never took my eyes off him, and
I tell you he’s in earnest.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean he’s among them that believe there’s a God,
and have made up their mind to serve him.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” said the master. “You have made your
report, and now you may go.”</p>

<p>The next night there was a new watchman around the
rich infidel’s house. It was he who went to church on a
Sunday.</p>

<h2>SINGLE AND DOUBLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FARMER who owned a lazy horse was riding him
barebacked one day, when the beast began to complain
of his load, saying:</p>

<p>“Such a heavy man as you ought to ride in a wagon and
have a pair instead of one poor overworked horse to carry
him.”</p>

<p>The farmer made no reply, but jogged on quietly.
Presently he came up with one of his neighbors afoot.
The farmer slackened his pace and the man walked beside
him in the road, the two talking together about their corn,
and oats, and clover. They had not gone far before the
farmer noticed a limp in his neighbor’s gait.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” said he.</p>

<p>“A sharp peg in my boot,” replied the other, “seems
to object to my walking.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better get up and ride behind me,” said
the farmer.</p>

<p>“That I will,” said the man—“gladly; and thank you.”</p>

<p>As he clambered on to the horse from the top of a
fence beside which his friend had stopped, the animal
said to himself:</p>

<p>“Ah! I did not know when I was well off. Willingly
now would I carry my master alone, but another behind
him almost breaks my back. Never again will I complain
of my load until I have asked myself how I should feel
if it were suddenly made twice as heavy.”</p>

<h2>THE BOASTFUL FLY.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FLY that had lodged on a crumbling wall, seeing other
flies swarming around it, began to boast about their
numbers, saying:</p>

<p>“Look at us! Multitudes in this little space! We
are everywhere—in the garden among the flowers, in the
field amid the clover, in the woods darting in and out of
the sunbeams that fall between the branches.”</p>

<p>Here a humming-bird lighted in a trumpet-vine that
grew over the wall. Said the fly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are a traveller, sir, I hear, and have been to
other countries. Pray, have you ever been in any place
where there are no flies?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said the humming-bird.</p>

<p>“Oh that I had your strong wings,” cried the fly,
“to carry me where I could see the flies that live far
away as well as those that live here! But you have
seen them; maybe, now, you can guess how many flies
there are?”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said the bird. “You cannot be counted.
Why, all the bluebirds and blackbirds, the humming-birds,
and birds of every kind, put together, are as nothing compared
with you!”</p>

<p>“We are the people,” continued the boastful fly, raising
its tiny voice—“not so big as some others, we’ll admit,
but look at our numbers: myriads upon myriads!”</p>

<p>“Great in numbers, it is true,” said a mossy stone in
the wall, “but one thing you’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the fly.</p>

<p>“That midsummer is already past, and in a few short
weeks the green will have faded from the fields, and
frost will cover the ground; and then, though we look
diligently for you, not one of all your myriads shall
be found.”</p>

<h2>THE MENDED BOOTS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who had a pair of boots that needed mending
carried them to the cobbler’s and dropped them beside
his bench, saying, “They’ll do any time to-day; send
them home as soon as they are finished,” and without waiting
for an answer departed.</p>

<p>While the cobbler was examining the boots and preparing
to go to work on them, another man, with a badly-worn
pair in his hand, came into the shop, and said:</p>

<p>“I want you to mend these at once; I’ll send for them
in the evening.”</p>

<p>At this the cobbler let the first pair fall upon the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
saying to himself: “As he will send, I must be sure and
have them ready.”</p>

<p>And, going to work on them, he kept at it until they
were done. In the evening the man’s little son called,
and carried them away with him.</p>

<p>The next day, after breakfast, as he sat down on his
bench, the cobbler said:</p>

<p>“Now I must get at the other pair, that was left first.”</p>

<p>But just as he was putting the last into one of them, a
man entered the shop with a quick step and handed him a
pair of shoes that were almost worn to pieces:</p>

<p>“I must have these, without fail, in the morning,” he
cried, “and will call for them myself. On no account disappoint
me.”</p>

<p>The cobbler at once dropped the boot that was in his
lap, and, seeming to have caught the man’s ardor, thrust
the last into one of his shoes and continued to work diligently
until evening, and so finished them.</p>

<p>In the morning the man appeared, with as rapid a step
as ever, and, finding his shoes done, paid for them, and was
quickly gone.</p>

<p>A little while after this, as the cobbler sat calmly reading
his newspaper, the man who left the first pair strolled
into the shop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">

boots with me.” But, seeing a confused look on the cobbler’s
face, he added:</p>

<p>“Of course they’re ready; you know they were to be
done the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>Then, looking on the floor, he saw them lying exactly
where he had left them.</p>

<p>“I’ve been so very bu—busy,” stammered the cobbler,
“that I haven’t got ’em quite finished yet.”</p>

<p>“‘Quite finished’!” exclaimed the man. “Why, you
haven’t touched them!”</p>

<p>“But I’m going to begin this minute,” said the cobbler,
“and you shall have them to-morrow, for certain.”</p>

<h2>THE CRIPPLE AND HIS STAFF.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;POOR cripple who had to go on foot to the hospital
(where only he could be cured) cut a staff to help him
in walking. It was the best he could get from the woods
that grew by the way, and was just like those that other
cripples used on that same road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;">
<img src="images/illus345.jpg" width="519" height="673" alt="man resting beside road with staff" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time, as long as the road was smooth, the staff
seemed to be all that he needed; but when he came to
an uneven place, he found that it did not answer. It was
too short, though as long as that sort of wood grew, and
it was too rough, hurting his hand as he leaned upon it.
Beside this, it did not take a firm hold on the ground, but
slipped from under him, giving him many falls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>After one of these falls, while he was lying prostrate
and hardly able to rise, a man came to him with a pair
of crutches in his hand. The man raised him up from
the ground, put the crutches under his arms, and showed
him how to walk with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the poor cripple was overjoyed to find that
he could walk with comparative ease and with perfect
safety. Yet he kept the staff that he had cut for himself,
carrying it, thrust under his girdle, across his back,
behind him.</p>

<p>He walked leaning on his crutches for a considerable
distance and over a good deal of rough ground, and then
came to another smooth spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 518px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a desire seized him to try his staff again. But
why should he want to do this? In the first place, he
had forgotten in that short space of time the falls it had
before given him. Then it seemed as if the staff would
be lighter and more easily handled than the crutches.
But perhaps the chief reason was that he would not
appear so great a cripple with the staff as with the
crutches; for above all things else the cripple desires to
appear not a cripple, and to seem to walk as if nothing
were the matter with him.</p>

<p>So he tried his staff again, and for a time got along
quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">

</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>While he was walking at his best, hardly limping, as
he thought, a man came to him saying:</p>

<p>“How well you walk! That staff is just the thing for
you. But you don’t need the crutches; why do you cumber
yourself with them?”</p>

<p>With this the man took hold of the crutches to take
them from him, but the cripple would not let go of them.
The man stood and reasoned a while with him; but when
he found it was of no use, he turned away, disgusted, saying,
as he left him:</p>

<p>“Any way, you are a fool, to keep both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The cripple had not gone much farther, leaning on his
staff, when he came to some more rough ground, where
he floundered about for a while and then fell to the earth,
striking his head and bringing the blood. Then he was
glad that he had not parted with the crutches. He drew
them out from behind him, put them under his arms, and
proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>Now we should think that he would never trust to his
staff again. But it was not so. He hardly ever came to
a smooth place that he did not draw it forth and walk with
it, till he learned again, by sad experience, that it would
not support him; so that this was, in fact, the history of
his going—toiling along with his staff and falling, and
then betaking himself to his crutches once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he came to the foot of the hill on the top of
which was the hospital. But the ascent of that hill! he
was terrified as he looked at it. It was covered with rocks
and rolling stones, and beside its steep path was a yawning
chasm. He stood gazing at it for a moment, and then, as
if realizing for the first time his actual needs, he drew forth
his staff and cast it from him as far as his strength would
send it.</p>

<p>Now, he had not known himself what a weight that
staff had been to him, for no sooner was he rid of it than
it seemed to him almost as if he had wings. Then, resting
wholly on his crutches, he addressed himself to his last
labor. And, truly, those who looked after him saw that
he made that most difficult ascent (up to the place where
he knew there was a Physician who would heal him) as if
it were the easiest part of his journey.</p>

<h2>THE SEARCH.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN had a never-failing spring in his grounds, the
water from which he brought through pipes to his
house. There it was used for drinking, cooking, washing,
and all domestic purposes. After a time, however, the
family became aware that, from some cause, the water
was tainted. They were loth to acknowledge this, but
it was so evident that all their wishes to the contrary could
not deceive them.</p>

<p>The first thing the man did was to go to the spring and
examine it. No water could look purer. He dipped a cupful
from the surface, and drank it without detecting any
unpleasant taste. What was next to be done? He had
heard of a filter for sale at the village store. It would
cost several dollars, but the doctor’s bill might come to
a great deal more. There was no help for it: the filter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a><br /><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
was bought and placed where every drop from the spring
passed through it before being used at the house. Reluctant
indeed were the man and his family, after such an
expense, still to recognize, without being able to detect
the cause of, the impurity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">

</div>

<p>But one course was left, and that was to take up and
examine every foot of pipe through which the water ran.
This required a whole day’s labor. Nevertheless, it was
done. No dead toads or frogs were found in it, so it was
carefully cleaned and laid back in its place. The water
was turned on again, and, although there was in reality
no reason to look for an improvement, the family felt
disappointed when it became evident, after all this additional
trouble, that the disagreeable taste remained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus363.jpg" width="520" height="666" alt="man digging by well" />
</div>

<p>The man sat silent all the evening after his hard day’s
work, discouraged, but still trying to devise some means
of prosecuting his search. The next morning he rose up
bright and early, and without saying a word to any
one put his long post-spade over his shoulder and walked
out to the spring. There, beginning a little way back from
its edge, he began to dig. Finding nothing but good top-soil,
with clay underneath, he pursued his labors until he
had gone almost the whole way around it. Then he came
suddenly upon a dark spot in the earth. He dug into it
still deeper; the odor that arose from it revealed its nature:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a><br /><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
it was a mass of decay. He uncovered it to the spring’s
side, and found that it cropped out there at the very spot
where his pipe opened into the water. At last the cause
of all his trouble was revealed.</p>

<p>It was no small task to dam back the rising tide, so that
the foul matter could be removed and replaced with pure
earth. But, now that he could see where to direct his
efforts, this was a simple matter, requiring only persevering
labor, which was willingly bestowed; and so in due
time the work was well and thoroughly done and the
object attained. And the man and his family continued
ever afterward to enjoy the pure water of the spring.</p>

<h2>THE SWALLOWS AND THE WINDMILL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;PAIR of swallows, while looking for a barn in which
to build, came across a windmill, with its sails furled
and its great wheel standing motionless.</p>

<p>“What sort of a place is this?” they said. “Surely no
better can be found for our home. We’ll let other swallows
go into the old tumble-down barns around, but this beautiful
tower we will secure for ourselves.”</p>

<p>Then, flying below the dome-like roof of the mill,
they discovered a small window, just under the eaves,
with a pane of glass broken out, through which they
darted, and soon picked out a spot under a rafter inside
for their nest. At once they went to work building it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
A pond near by supplied them with mud. Working up
little balls of this with their bills, they carried them into
the mill and fastened them against the rafter they had
chosen. In this way, adding little by little, as a bricklayer
builds up a house, they built up the walls of their
nest. Then they brought grass to line the inside, coiling
it around nicely that it might be smooth and even.
Last of all, above the grass, they made a bed of soft
feathers.</p>

<p>Now, it happened, the very next night after all this was
finished, that a strong wind sprang up, and the next morning
early the miller appeared and went into his mill. Presently
he came out again, and, standing on the ground,
under the great wheel, began to unfurl the sails on each
of its four arms, one after the other. As soon as this
was done, loosening its fastenings he let the wheel go;
and the wind, filling the sails, began to turn it around—at
first slowly, but gradually faster and faster, until it
was running at full speed.</p>

<p>The swallows, that were taking a holiday after their
labors, and flying about joyously up in the air, looked
down surprised at what was going on. But their surprise
was turned to dismay when they found that the wheel
was revolving directly in front of the little window
through which they gained entrance into the mill. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a><br /><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
flew from side to side, hour after hour, hoping the wheel
would stop; but it never once rested through the day
or the night, and continued to go until another morning
appeared. Then, wearied out and in despair, they lodged
on a fence near by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/illus367.jpg" width="507" height="656" alt="windmill and swallows; horse and cart" />
</div>

<p>Here another swallow, that had her home in a neighboring
barn, saw them perched with drooping wings.
Lighting beside them, she asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>“‘Matter’!” cried they. “We are ruined. The man
in yonder mill tied up his horrid wheel just long enough
for us to build our nest under his roof, and then set it
going. Look at it! Were we inside, we could never
get out; and now that we are out, we can never get
in. So cruelly have we been deceived!”</p>

<p>“You have been deceived, my friends, that is
true,” replied the other, gently, “but not by the
miller: you have deceived yourselves. What does
he care for swallows? It was your place to inquire
how the building was used, before making your nest
in it. Instead of doing this, you took the risk, and
so have lost your labor. But do not despair as
though all had been lost. If you will be satisfied to
lodge like other swallows, and will come to our barn,
across yonder field, there is plenty of room left
over the haymow, and time enough too, for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
build another nest; and there you may yet rear your
brood in peace and content.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">When we take for granted what we ought to prove
by careful research, we are apt to be disappointed in
the result; especially is caution needed when, leaving
the old beaten track, we venture to mark out a new

<h2>THE MEDICINE-MAN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who lived in an unhealthy region of country
supported himself by preparing and selling a medicine
which acted as an antidote to the malarial or other
poison prevailing there. This poison was taken into the
system through the air the people breathed, the water
they drank, and the food they ate. The entire population
was suffering from it. Unless its effects were
arrested, they became in the end fatal. The medicine,
however, was a certain cure. Nature had evidently provided
it as a remedy for a people otherwise incurably
smitten, and the man who made a business of preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
it put it up in such quantities that there was an abundant
supply within the reach of all by whom it was needed.</p>

<p>But here was a curious thing: The man himself neglected
to take of the medicine. This was not because he
had escaped the prevailing infection. Signs of it in his
own person were evident enough to his friends, and some
of them who had been cured through his means took
occasion to speak with him on the subject. Said one of
them:</p>

<p>“No one knows better than yourself the value of this
remedy. And though it be not always pleasant to take,
and requires some self-denial while using, what is this to
the risk of one’s life?”</p>

<p>To this reasonable appeal the man at first made no
answer; but when further pressed, he replied as follows:</p>

<p>“Am I doing any harm, that I should be thus annoyed
and interfered with? Is it not better that I should deal
out this medicine than poison to the people?”</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” said his friend. “You are doing no
harm, but good, to others, but are not resisting the harm
that is being done to yourself.”</p>

<p>“That is a personal matter,” said the man, “with which
nobody else has anything to do. I can attend to my own
health, and have no wish that another should prescribe for
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>So they could do no more, but had to stand by and see
the fatal malady increasing upon him.</p>

<p>It was like looking at a man standing in the water,
breast-deep, with the vessel sinking under him, and he,
after handing all the rest into the lifeboat, turning a deaf
ear when they begged him to come too, and be saved.</p>

<h2>THE EAGLE AND THE WREN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WREN that came into a mountainous region where
mining was carried on, having found a deserted pit,
made her nest in a hole in its side. One hot summer day
an eagle lodged on the branch of a pine tree that stood
near the pit, and spied the little wren coming up out of
its mouth. Said the eagle:</p>

<p>“So you are not satisfied with getting down on to the
ground? You must burrow under it to make your nest!
Well, every creature finds its own proper level; but can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a><br /><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
you see so far as that lofty crag on the top of yonder
mountain? There, up among the clouds, is where I sit
with my young, looking down on you little birds that
dare not fly to the height of our home.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
<img src="images/illus375.jpg" width="524" height="676" alt="eagle lying on ground with broken wing talking to starling" />
</div>

<p>The wren, overawed by the eagle’s voice, made no
answer, but flew down into the pit again.</p>

<p>The day grew hotter and hotter; the birds through the
woods ceased singing and the insects chirping; all nature
seemed oppressed by the heat. In the afternoon a small
black cloud appeared in the west. It rose rapidly, and
soon spread over the whole sky. Then there was a
strange sound heard in the distance. It grew louder and
nearer. As it approached, tall forest trees bent over and
snapped asunder, and great branches, and heavy stones
even, were seen flying through the air. It lasted but a
moment, and then all was still again.</p>

<p>Now, the wren, hidden in the hole in the pit’s side, had
not heard the noise of the storm; but, coming up soon
afterward to hunt for a worm, she was dismayed at the
scene of desolation that met her eye. Great trunks of
trees, and rocks, were strewn over the earth, while among
them lay prostrate the eagle and her young. The young
ones were dead, and their mother, with a broken wing, in
her effort to rise, was vainly beating the ground.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the wren, “what has wrought such sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
ruin? And how is it that I have escaped, when a strong
eagle has been cast down?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied the eagle, “had I been a wren with a
lowly nest, like you, instead of a proud eagle with her nest
built on high, the tornado, which you did not even hear,
would have left me and mine, too, unharmed.”</p>

<h2>THE TWO SAPLINGS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO slender saplings were planted on the same day—one
before the house of a rich man, and the other
at a poor man’s door.</p>

<p>The summer passed, and winter came. Then, as the
rich man saw his young tree tossed to and fro by the
storm, he was afraid it would be broken; so he went to
it and built a fence around it and spread a roof over it.
But the poor man, because he had to labor out in the
storm himself, never thought of sheltering his tree.</p>

<p>Season followed after season; the rich man was still
nursing his tree, and, as it grew, building his fence up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a><br /><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
higher and higher. But the poor man’s tree was left to
the sunshine, the wind, and the rain.</p>

<img src="images/illus379.jpg" width="509" height="670" alt="top scene: Rich man building shelter for tree; lower scene: poor man heading off to work in storm" />
</div>

<p>And now long years have gone; youth has fled, and
age has come. The rich man can no longer keep up his
watchful care, nor the poor man go forth to his labor. But,
as they sit resting at their doors at the close of the day, the
poor man sees, towering above him, a strong oak in its prime,
spreading its protecting branches over his roof; while the
rich man sees a weak and unhealthy trunk that is already
decaying at the root, and destined hardly to outlast himself.</p>

<h2>THE COG-WHEEL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SMALL cog-wheel in the upper part of a great printing-press
came to the conclusion that it was not turned
by the steam-engine, but turned of its own accord. Having
taken up this notion, in a little while it brought itself to
believe that it drove the whole press.</p>

<p>“It is easy to see,” it said, “that the other wheels keep
time with my movements, going slow when I go slow, and
fast when I run at greater speed. From this it is plain that
I give motion to the whole, and that all the work of the
press depends upon me.”</p>

<p>Then it began to boast about that work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<img src="images/illus383.jpg" width="522" height="672" alt="printer handing cog to printer's boy" />
</div>

<p>“Look,” it said, “at that great sheet of white paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a><br /><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
It is laid on my feed-board blank and meaningless, but
comes out from under my cylinder covered with the
clearest print. It is a newspaper, which is distributed
by tens of thousands over the land. At other times I print
books. Some are learned ones, for scholars to read; some
are children’s books filled with pictures, and of these last
I assert that nothing made of paper and ink can be more
beautiful. But it is all my work, neither could it possibly
be done without me, as I will now prove by holding back
for a moment the entire press.”</p>

<p>Saying which, the wheel turned a little on its side, thus
hindering the one next to it. But just at that moment the
pressman, stepping up and seeing some derangement in its
movement, stopped the press. Then, calling to a boy, who
was covered with printer’s ink from head to foot,</p>

<p>“Run quickly,” he said, “to the store-room and bring
me another cog-wheel.”</p>

<p>No sooner had the boy brought it than the pressman,
slipping off the old wheel, put the new one in its place.</p>

<p>“Take this,” he said, handing the old one to the boy,
“and throw it on the scrap-heap.”</p>

<p>In another moment the press was running again at full
speed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FARMER, having bought a new mowing-machine,
brought it home and put it in the barn where his
plough was housed, waiting for the opening of spring.</p>

<p>When the mower, in its bright paint and glossy varnish,
saw the soiled and toil-worn plough, it said, with a scornful
look:</p>

<p>“Why am I placed in such low company?”</p>

<h2>FAT AND LEAN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;STRONG fat ox stood with his eyes half shut, chewing
the cud, while his driver heaped up a heavy load
of stone on the cart he was yoked to.</p>

<p>A neighbor, who chanced to be riding by on a fast but
very lean horse, stopped to speak to the man. The horse,
on being held in, began to paw the ground, as if impatient
to go on, then, looking around scornfully at the ox, said:</p>

<p>“What do you stand there chewing the cud for now?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” asked the ox. “What harm does
it do?”</p>

<p>“When I’m in harness,” replied the horse, “I like to
work, and not go to sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have to do my share of work,” said the ox; “there’s
no doubt about that. If you’ll wait till I get the word,
you’ll see how I pull. When I come to a heavy hill, I
stop chewing the cud; but as soon as I come to a level
place, I begin again. For even while I’m at work I take
all the comfort I can.”</p>

<p>“‘Comfort’!” exclaimed the horse. “Is that your aim?
Mine is to pass every other team on the road.”</p>

<h2>HALF EMPTY AND QUITE FULL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN a quiet, lonely spot, beside a mountain-road, a half
barrel stood partly sunk in the ground. A small
wooden trough resting on its rim led the water from a
spring that was hidden a little way back in the woods.
The water was for ever running into it, yet the half barrel
was never full. Its hoops were loosened, its joints opened,
and much of the pure stream that it received escaped,
trickling down its sides and sinking into the earth. But
while it was never full, except perhaps once or twice in a
summer, when there fell such a flood of rain as overcame
all its leaks and openings, neither was it ever quite empty;
for, although it was a poor leaky vessel at best, it had never
quite fallen to pieces.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond this spot, on that mountain-road,
stood what looked to be the other half of the same barrel.
A trough exactly similar to the first led a stream of water
into it, but this half barrel, compact and tight, was always
full to the brim ready to spare some of its refreshing contents
to the tired traveller, who, after he had quenched his
own thirst, unreined his horse and allowed him to sink his
mouth deeply into it and drink.</p>

<h2>THE SNAKE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;BEAUTIFUL and harmless little garter-snake was
gliding across the road, when a man who happened
to be passing seized a club and struck it a crushing blow.
As it writhed in agony it turned to its assailant and
said:</p>

<p>“Why do you kill me?”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” replied the man, “I will let anything
in the form of a snake live, when I know there are
venomous copperheads in this very woods?”</p>

<p>“And are there no men,” asked the snake, “that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
revengeful and dangerous, and would you destroy all men
for their sake?”</p>

<h2>RICH AND POOR.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO men were neighbors—one rich, the other poor—and
both of them had children of whom they were
fond. The children of the rich man received many costly
presents of such things as young people prize, but the children
of the poor man had only their food and clothing, and
that of the plainest sort.</p>

<p>Years passed by. Both families grew up like young trees
in an orchard, and in due season began to display the fruits
of their training, when the rich man, meeting his poor neighbor
one day, said to him:</p>

<p>“I have been watching your children, and I notice they
appear to feel as though they could never see enough of
you or do enough for you. It is not so with mine. I
wonder if you can tell the secret of this difference?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it lies here,” replied the poor man: “As I am
unable to draw my children to me by what I can give them,
I have to try and accomplish it by what I can do for them.
To this end I am careful about four things—viz.: To be as
sparing as I can of my censure when they do wrong; to
be as liberal as I can of my praise when they do right; to
take an interest in whatever interests them; and to let them
see that I deny myself to supply their needs as far as I
can.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied the rich man, “wherein our plans have
differed: you have worked for what I have tried to buy. I
gave of my money, you of what costs more—forbearance,
consideration, and love. So I have been shut out of my
children’s hearts, while you have gained an entrance into
yours. I thank you for the lesson you have taught me,
and purpose, though I begin late, to profit by it.”</p>

<h2>THE HAWK AND THE CHICKEN.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HAWK, as it soared on high, seeing a young chicken
in the field below, rapidly descended, and seized it in
his talons.</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the chicken, “I have no power to struggle,
or any hope of saving myself by resisting you in any way.
But I pray you listen to me. I am yet young, hardly
grown, and am just beginning to enjoy roaming through
the fields by myself. Do not cut off my days. I beg you
out of pity to spare my life.”</p>

<p>“What you say may be all true,” said the hawk. “I
don’t pretend to know whether it is, or is not; all I do
know is that I am hungry, and that you are the only food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a><br /><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
provided for me. I can’t go into any reasonings behind
that.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/illus403.jpg" width="516" height="673" alt="hawk capturing chicken and flying away with it" />
</div>

<p>Saying which, he dug his talons deeper into the flesh
of his victim, and, carrying it off, devoured it on a neighboring
tree.</p>

<p>At this a horse that was feeding in the meadow below,
and had heard the birds speaking, said to himself:</p>

<p>“As I don’t wear feathers or fly with wings, I won’t
presume to judge those who do. But, as for me, I know
it is my duty to earn my living by honest labor and let
other people alone.”</p>

<h2>THE SERVANT’S MONEY.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CERTAIN king sent a message to one of his servants
who lived in a distant part of his kingdom,
bidding the servant come to him, and promising that
henceforth all his wants should be supplied in the king’s
palace.</p>

<p>The servant, overjoyed at the message, prepared at
once to obey it; but, being a poor man who through long
years of saving and pinching had come to set great store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
by small possessions, it went very hard with him to leave
behind such things as he could call his own—the little
house he lived in, with the plot of ground around it, and
the few rude implements with which he tilled the soil.
As it was impossible, however, to take them with him, he
sold them for what he could get (which was not much);
and then, packing up his clothes in divers parcels and
hiding his little store of money among them, he started
on his journey.</p>

<p>The first part of this, which led through well-tilled
fields and among people whom he knew, was very pleasant.
Many who were his friends came out, as he passed by, to
meet him, begging him to stop and rest a while in their
houses. And when it happened to be toward evening, he
went in and supped and lodged with them.</p>

<p>But after leaving this part of the country he came
to a bleak and lonely region abounding in rocks and
caves. Here, as he was pressing on, hoping to get through
it safely, some robbers rushed out from their hiding-place
upon him. Hastily looking through the bundles with
which he was loaded, and finding they were made up
of old worn-out clothes, they refused to take them.
But, in making the search, they spied his money, and,
seizing it, quickly disappeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 533px;">
<img src="images/illus407.jpg" width="533" height="678" alt="story: man recieves summons; loses belongings on way; struggles on" />
</div>

<p>When the poor man saw them hurrying away with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a><br /><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
treasure—which, small as it was, represented his lifelong
labors—his grief overcame him, and he sat down and wept.
But, presently recovering himself, he said:</p>

<p>“Shall I stay here crying in this wilderness, when I am
sent for by the king?”</p>

<p>Then he rose up from the ground, and pursued his way
without further interruption, though with a heavy heart
and faltering step, until he came to the gates of the
king’s palace. There he found many others assembled
from different parts of the kingdom, who had also come
at the king’s command—some of them poor like himself,
some rich; and they all waited for the day when the
gates should open.</p>

<p>But while they were waiting for this what was his
surprise to see the poor draw forth their pence, and the
rich their silver and gold, and throw them away! For
they had been told they would have no need of them
within the gates, and that until they had parted with
them they could not enter. So they all cast their money
from them, whether it was little or much, and it lay
scattered over the ground, with none to gather it. Neither
was the servant any poorer than the richest of them,
though he had been robbed of all. Then he said to
himself, “How foolish was I to set such store by, and
grieve so much after, what was of no real value!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>And after that, with nothing except the garments that
they wore (and even these had been given them), he and
all who waited with him entered joyfully into the palace-gates.</p>

<h2>FUTURE GREATNESS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO young colts, each by the side of its mother, were at
pasture in adjoining fields. The mother of one, coming
to the dividing fence, and putting her head over it,
said to her neighbor:</p>

<p>“Just look at the color of my colt! Was there ever
a lovelier bay? Before another spring has passed over
his head I expect to see him in the stable of some millionaire.
You know what a rage there is among rich
men for fast horses. Now, look at the points in my colt—his
long, clean limbs, his deer-like shape, his full eye
and broad nostril. I am as certain of his speed as if he
had just been around the track and I heard the time-keeper
calling out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Two minutes ten and a half seconds!’”</p>

<p>“I have been looking at your colt,” replied the other,
“and admit he promises well; but what do you think of
the little roan on this side the fence? Now, I wouldn’t
care to have him in a millionaire’s stable, or put him there,
if I could, by a wish. Those rich men think of nobody
but themselves, and keep fine horses only to swell their
own importance. Then they are speculators, to a man;
there’s no telling how long they’ll keep their money. Let
that go, and their horses go with it, to the jockey and the
race-course, to be abused and betted on and driven to
death.</p>

<p>“No; I would rather see my colt in the hands of some
grand, rich lady—the gem of her stable, her daily companion
and pet. And is he not made for it? Look at
his round, short body, so plump and easily kept; his strong,
arched neck, and his beautiful thick mane and tail. And
mark my words: it won’t be long before all that I predict
about him comes true. In fact, I think I know who the
lady is already. She drives by here in her barouche with
liveried coachman and footman, each with a bouquet in his
buttonhole, and as she passes I can see her looking over
the fence.”</p>

vanished, and we are again visiting the fields where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a><br /><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
above interview took place. One of them is being
ploughed, and a stout roan horse is stepping briskly in
front of the furrow; the other field its owner is clearing
of stones, and a young bay is hauling out a heavy cart-load
of them. Both horses are strong and willing helpers
on the farm, earning an honest living, valued and well
cared for by their masters, and far better off than they
would be if left to the heedless servants of the fashionable
lady or the proud millionaire.</p>

<h2>THE OLD MAN’S WATCH.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AN old man and a young one were walking together over
a rough and hilly road. Said the old man:</p>

<p>“Though I detain you by being unable to keep up
with your rapid step, yet, in spite of this feeble frame, I
am feeling in spirit as young as you. Perhaps you can
hardly believe this?”</p>

<p>“I can believe it if you say so,” replied the young
man, “but confess that when I look at your snowy locks
and your bent form, I cannot understand it.”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” said the old man, drawing out
his watch and exposing its works to view. “You see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
that, like myself, this watch has seen its best days. Its
case shows wear, and so do its works. These little cog-wheels
do not fit into each other as closely as they once did,
and they are growing farther apart, by wear, every day.
But now look at the mainspring, where it lies, here, coiled
up by itself. It shows no wear. The same power and
elasticity it has had all along remain in it still.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied the other; and, becoming so interested
in the watch as to forget it was being used only as an
illustration, he continued: “Why do you not have the
rest of the works repaired?”</p>

<p>“Your question is natural,” said the old man. “So I
might have these worn-out works repaired, but not this
worn-out body. Neither do I desire it. It will soon have
done its work and lasted out its appointed time here.
But in another state of being the immortal part—the
mainspring, so to speak—will live on, clothed with a
new body as immortal as itself. It is this that still remains
as vigorous as ever, and makes me feel, in spirit, as young
as yourself.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">As we advance in years we are conscious of that
within us which does not grow old, but which, having
learned that this world cannot satisfy, grows weary of
it, and peers anxiously into the next.</p>

<h2>THE TEACHER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;DREAMED that I had started on a journey, and as I
trudged along the path alone a man carrying a mirror,
stopped me, saying:</p>

<p>“I want to speak with you.”</p>

<p>I replied: “From whence do you come, and what
may your calling be?”</p>

<p>He answered: “I come from beyond that steep hill in
front of you which you have yet to climb; and I am a
teacher, teaching by the things that I show in my mirror.”</p>

<p>Then he held his mirror up before my eyes and told me
to look. I obeyed, and saw a ship tossed in a storm. The
sails were blown to pieces, the boats were broken, the deck
was swept by the waves, and the ship was ready to sink.
Then I saw the master come to the side, and stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a><br /><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
there pouring oil from a vessel in his hand on the angry
waters. And presently, although the storm continued to
rage over the rest of the ocean, the ship seemed to be
rocked in a little basin that was calm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">
<img src="images/illus419.jpg" width="517" height="649" alt="traveler meeting man in road carrying mirror" />
</div>

<p>Said the teacher: “Gentleness overcomes where resistance
would be in vain.”</p>

<p>He held up the mirror again, and I saw two stone-cutters
at work dressing a great block of granite. On
the wall above them was a clock. Now, one of the men
stood with his back to the clock, so that he could not
see it, and his arm dealt strong and rapid blows on the
stone, seeming never to tire. But the other man stood
facing the clock, and was constantly lifting up his eyes
to it; and I noticed that his arm was raised slowly and
feebly, as if losing its strength, and his face wore an
expression of weariness.</p>

<p>The teacher said: “He who does not set his heart
on his task, but on the rest that comes after it, makes
poor work for his employer and long hours for himself.”</p>

<p>Again he held the mirror up, and I saw a vine planted
in the ground, with branches growing out of each side.
Now, the vine was as if it were made of glass, so that I
could see the sap running from the stalk into the branches.
And as it did this they all put forth leaves and blossoms.
But suddenly, as I looked, the sap ceased to flow into one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a><br /><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
of the branches. Then the buds and blossoms fell from it
to the earth, and the branch withered and died before my
eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<img src="images/illus421.jpg" width="506" height="656" alt="ship at sea in storm" />
</div>

<p>Said the teacher: “It is not what the branch gives,
but what it receives, that makes it of value in the vineyard.”</p>

<p>He held up the mirror again, and I saw a man with a
lantern leading a company that followed him on a dark
and narrow path. But presently he closed his eyes, and,
as he did so, stumbled and fell. Then one of his followers
seized the lantern from his hand and led the others in safety,
but the one who had fallen did not return again.</p>

<p>The teacher said: “Even the guide who points out the
way must tread carefully, or he may step aside and be lost.”</p>

<p>Again he held up the mirror, and I saw a great fire
burning—not near, but, as it were, in a far-off abyss. In
it were being consumed what I had always looked upon
as the greatest works of men. And those of my own
works in which I had taken the greatest pride were also
being devoured by the flames. Only a few of the deeds
that had seemed to me of lesser value, but that had been
done for love (the love of One who first loved me), stood
unconsumed in the fire.</p>

<p>And the teacher said: “Behold true and false immortality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more he held up the mirror, and I saw a man
carrying a heavy load up a hill. The hill grew steeper
at every step, and the man bent down under the weight
of the load until his forehead nearly touched the ground
in front of him. Then I saw one having a face full
of love and a strong arm come up beside the man.
But just as I supposed he was going to help him, what
was my surprise to see this strong one pick up a heavy
stone and put it on the top of his burden! Then I looked
to see the man sink down, crushed, to the earth, but I saw
the other touch him, and by that touch new strength was
given him; so that he bore this heavy burden more easily
than he had borne the lighter one.</p>

<p>And the teacher said: “No load is to be feared if
only the strength be given to bear it.”</p>

<p>Then he took the mirror from before me and held
it up to his own lips, breathing upon it. And I saw
the vapor gather on its surface for a moment and then
disappear.</p>

<p>And the teacher said: “Such are good impressions
when made on the heart of man unless a higher Power
fix them there.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CLOUD came sailing on the wind, which died away
just as it reached a fruitful field.</p>

<p>“Pass on,” said the field, “and let me see the blue
sky.”</p>

<p>The cloud spread itself out to catch the little air that
was left, and slowly passed on to a field beyond. There
it hung motionless. In the night it began to drop its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
watery contents upon the thirsty sward beneath, so that
every green blade glistened as the sun rose upon it, and
sprang up with renewed freshness and beauty. The field
that had complained, seeing this and being parched with
the sun’s rays, said:</p>

<p>“Ah that I had borne the cloud’s presence a while for
the sake of the blessing it contained! I was impatient
under its shadow, and now long for that which my neighbor
has gained who submitted to its visitation without
murmuring.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A GOOD natured poodle-dog, while trotting along the

<p>“Why do you look so mournful?” asked the poodle.
“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he bite you back again?”</p>

<p>“No, and that makes me feel all the worse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, cheer up; it’s over now, and very likely
you’ll never see him any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will, though, for he’s a relation of mine.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll never bite him again after being so sorry
for it—I’m sure of that—and that’s some comfort.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not sure, for I’ve done it before, and been
sorry too. When anything doesn’t please me, all at once I
get so mad that I hardly know what I’m about, and then
I’m ready to bite my dearest friend.”</p>

<p>“No, I only mean that I lose my temper. I’m sorry
for it every time, but I go on losing it and biting my

it, and don’t know what to do.”</p>

give yourself up to the dog-catchers, the better.”</p>

<h2>THE DRY WELL.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;man who had always been able to get as much water
from his well as he wanted, on drawing up the bucket
one hot summer day, found less than a cupful in it. There
was so little water at the bottom of the well that the bucket
could not turn over and fill itself. As soon as the man discovered
this he began abusing his well, saying:</p>

<p>“Is that all you can do? You are not worth the room
you take or the money you cost to dig. If there is any
one thing more useless and contemptible than another, it
is a well that holds no water.”</p>

<p>“Does all my past service go for nothing, then?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a><br /><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the well. “I have filled your bucket, year after year, with
unfailing streams, as you yourself know. And even now
what I have I willingly offer, to the last drop.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 528px;">
<img src="images/illus433.jpg" width="528" height="672" alt="farmer tipping over mostly empty well bucket" />

<p>“‘Drop’ indeed, and little more!” said the man. “But
what good will that do me? What I want is a barrelful
or a hogsheadful if I need it.”</p>

<p>“I have not the ocean to draw from,” replied the well,
“or even a river, but only one trickling spring. If that fails,
I have no other resource, but must wait till its dried-up
current begins to flow again. Can you, at all times,
command the same fulness and excellence in your own
work? Pray, do your powers never fail?”</p>

<h2>THE FRUIT TREE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FRUIT tree sprang up from a seed in the corner of
a certain man’s field. It grew rapidly and put forth
branches. Great was the man’s delight when he saw these
bearing blossoms.</p>

<p>“Now I shall have fruit of my own,” he said.</p>

<p>Autumn came and the fruit appeared, but as it ripened,
instead of growing round and rich and mellow, it grew
knotted and hard and bitter to the taste.</p>

<p>“’Tis because it is young and the soil where it stands
thin and poor,” the land-owner said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he loosened the ground around its roots and enriched
and watered it, and afterward waited for spring.
Spring came, and again the tree put forth blossoms and
bore fruit, more abundantly than before; but it was worthless
and unfit to be eaten.</p>

<p>Another winter passed and spring returned once more,
and one sunny morning, as the land-owner stood looking at
his tree and repining over it, there came a gardener by
that way.</p>

<p>“What troubles you?” he said, seeing the man’s sad
face.</p>

<p>“My tree has proved worthless,” replied the other.
“Yet I have done all that could be done to it, and still
it bears only evil fruit.”</p>

<p>At this the gardener took out his pruning-knife and
opening it, he came to the tree and at one stroke severed
its top, with all its spreading boughs, so that they fell
down on the ground, as fit only for the burning. Then
he made a deep cleft in the stock of the tree, and into
this he inserted a young shoot that he carried with him.
Next he anointed, with clay, the wound that his knife
had made, and wrapped it about carefully, and, turning
to the land-owner, said:</p>

<p>“Be patient; give it time. All yet will be well.”</p>

<p>Another season came. The new shoot put forth buds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
it blossomed, and then (after the gardener had grafted it,
but not before) the tree brought forth good fruit.</p>

<h2>THE DEER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;DEER that lived in a country far from the abodes
of men used to stay during the winter on some
low-lying lands where she could find patches of grass
growing through the cold weather, and thick coverts,
also, among the evergreens, in which to hide while the
fierce snow-storms were prevailing. But as soon as spring
returned she left the low-lands and hastened to a mountain
many miles away, and there, roaming over its wooded
heights and drinking from a quiet lake that lay spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
out on its very top, she stayed, rejoicing, all the summer
long.</p>

<p>After she had been doing thus for many years, and
when she was no longer young, it happened one winter
that certain strange sensations crept through her frame
such as she had never before known. She rose from
her lair with more difficulty than formerly, and walked
at times with an unsteady step. She grew weak and
thin, and afraid of the storms that she used to face
boldly when going forth in search of food. Then she
began to wonder, and say:</p>

<p>“What ails me, and what do these feelings mean?”</p>

<p>But presently she answered:</p>

<p>“I know what I need: it is a drink from the lake
on the mountain-top. When I can taste of it once more,
these feelings will pass away.”</p>

<p>So she waited in her low-land home, through the cold
and dreary winter days that remained, for the opening
buds and singing birds of spring. As soon as these
appeared she started on her journey to the mountain.
But now that journey seemed longer than it used to
seem. She had to rest oftener by the way. Instead of
leaping from crag to crag as she ascended the mountain-side,
she found herself picking out the easiest and safest
paths. Still laboring on up the steep ascent, she at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
reached the summit and stood beside the lake that she
loved. It looked the same. The rocks around its shores
were reflected in its bosom, the water-lilies floated on its
surface, the trees and wild-flowers grew down to its very
edge. All was as it had ever been. She said: “I shall
soon be well again;” and, putting her mouth down to the
water, drank. But presently she raised it slowly, saying:
“Either it is changed, or I am. It does not taste as it
once did, or bring the refreshment it has always before
brought to my wearied frame.”</p>

<p>Then, turning with feeble step to the bed of moss
under the thick bushes where she had so often rested
in years gone by, she lay down, to rise from it no more.
The fresh, pure mountain-breeze was still blowing; other
deer came and drank in new life and vigor at the lake; it
was as beautiful and its surroundings were as health-giving
as ever; but they could not recall the life that, having
reached its farther bound, had passed away.</p>

<h2>HOMELY AND HANDSOME.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HORSE and a cow that were turned out to pasture
together cropped the grass in company until they
came to a tree in the middle of the field, where they
stopped to rest in the shade. The cow lay down and
chewed the cud, but the horse stood switching off the
flies with his long tail.</p>

<p>While doing this he turned to the cow and said:</p>

<p>“I’ve just been thinking what a contrast there is between
us two. I am so swift, and you are so slow. You
travel only from the barn to the field in summer, and
hardly get out of the barnyard in winter. Your walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
is clumsy and awkward; and when you try to run, you
seem to have our old master’s rheumatism in every joint.
How different it is with me, galloping swiftly over the
country around, visiting our neighbors’ farms and hearing
of all that is going on! But then it is not your fault that
you were made to be only a cow, while I was made a fleet-footed
horse.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad,” said the cow, “that you are so well
satisfied with your lot, but I don’t want you to think I
am dissatisfied with mine. When our mistress pats me on
the side and calls me kind names, after milking, I feel proud
too. For this I go through the fields picking out the freshest
grass and the richest clover, saying to myself, ‘I’ll give
her a good pailful to-night.’ Then, when I see the red
cheeks of the children, I know I’ve had something to do
with them; and when our master drives you to market with
his butter-tub well filled, I have a notion he would miss
me, as well as you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deny,” replied the horse, “that you have your
good points and are useful in your way. I was only pitying
you for being so slow and so ugly.”</p>

<p>As he spoke these words he saw the farmer coming
through the gate into the field and bringing a strange
man with him. They came directly to the tree where
the horse and the cow were resting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the stranger, looking at the horse; “he’s
a smart, good-looking colt, and by putting him through
some pretty hard training I reckon I can work him off at
a fair profit. I’ll give you your price for him.”</p>

<p>“Then you can have him,” said the farmer. “If he’s
worth that, I can’t afford to keep him; a lower-priced beast
will do just as well for me.”</p>

<p>With that the old man slipped a halter over the horse’s
head and led him away. As he sadly followed his master
he looked back at the old cow, still contentedly chewing
her cud, and said:</p>

<p>“I go from this pleasant farm, where I was bred and
have lived so long, to be driven and beaten, and then sold
I know not where. Ah, my old friend! I wish now that I
was as ugly and as slow as you.”</p>

<h2>THE COLT AND OLD GRAY.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;COLT that had just been broken to harness was
driven in a milk-wagon every day to the city,
where he was fastened to a hitching-post, and left standing,
while the farmer went around to the neighboring
houses serving milk.</p>

<p>A boy on the way to his work one morning chanced to
rap against the post in passing, when the colt put back
his ears. Seeing this, the boy stopped and gave him a
thrust in the side, when the colt snapped at him and raised
his hind foot, showing that he was angry.</p>

<p>Instead of checking the boy, this only encouraged him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a><br /><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
so that the next morning he repeated his offence, and continued
to do it afterward every morning, seeming to take
a wicked delight in rousing the colt’s temper. Yet the
colt, being tied, could do nothing to revenge himself, as
the boy took good care to keep out of the reach of both
his teeth and his heels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<img src="images/illus447.jpg" width="522" height="675" alt="boy taunting horse" />
</div>

<p>One day, on going back to the stable, the colt told an
old gray horse that stood in the next stall how cruelly he
was tormented, without being able to stop his tormentor.</p>

<p>“I know how you could stop him,” said the old gray,
“and that without giving yourself the least trouble.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the colt.</p>

<p>“What will you give me for my secret?” asked Old
Gray.</p>

<p>“My share of the feed that we’ll get for our dinner.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Old Gray; “I’ll tell you as soon as
I have eaten it.”</p>

<p>In a little while the farmer passed through the stable,
and poured out six quarts of oats for each horse. And the
colt, although he was very hungry and his mouth watered
for them, allowed the old horse to put his head over and
eat up every grain in his manger.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the colt, impatiently, “tell me, as you
promised, how I can stop that young rogue from poking
at my ribs every morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>“In this way,” said the old horse. “Let him do it, and
pretend you don’t feel it.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say?” said the colt, angrily.
“I could have done that without being told, or being
cheated out of my dinner, either.”</p>

<p>“But you never thought of it till I told you,” said Old
Gray. “Now, just try it.”</p>

<p>As the oats were all gone and could never be gotten
back, the colt concluded there was no use in fretting any
more about them. Yet he found himself thinking over Old
Gray’s advice, and before night concluded to try it.</p>

<p>The next morning the boy came along as usual, and,
stealing up softly by the colt’s side, gave him a thrust in
the tender spot just behind his shoulder. The colt never
winced, nor even turned his eyes toward him. The boy
tried it again and again, with no better success, until he
had to hurry away, for fear of a scolding from his master.</p>

<p>For several mornings after this he renewed the attempt
(though with less spirit each morning), until, finding it made
no impression, he gave it up altogether, and passed by
whistling, with his hands in his pockets, as if no colt were
there.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, one evening about sundown, as the
colt was drinking in the stable-yard, Old Gray came in
from ploughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Said the colt, raising his head from the horse-trough:</p>

<p>“Your advice was good and worth the oats, after all.
I ask your pardon for being so rude the other morning.”</p>

<p>“I can easily forgive you,” said Old Gray. “Trifles do
not worry me. You are only a colt yet, just put to the
milk-wagon. You’ll be wiser by the time you get to the
plough.”</p>

<h2>THE KING’S ALMONER.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;KING was told that his subjects in a certain city were
suffering from hunger and cold and nakedness. Then
he said to himself,</p>

<p>“What man is there among them, of prudence and charity,
with whom I can intrust supplies for their relief?”</p>

<p>And one being named he sent to him stores of food and
raiment and money, with this message:</p>

<p>“These things are for the benefit of all the dwellers in
your city. Not that you should be neglected while others
are provided for; on the contrary, as you will have to wait
on the rest as my almoner, you may keep somewhat the
largest share for yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>So the man received what the king sent, and divided it
in due proportion between himself and the sufferers around
him.</p>

<p>But after doing this justly and generously for a time he
began, as new supplies came in, to increase his own portion
and diminish that which he divided among his neighbors,
thus making himself richer and richer, while they became
poorer and poorer.</p>

<p>Now, it was the king’s custom at certain seasons to leave
his royal palace and travel through his dominions, visiting
his people in every city; and, the time for his departure having
come, he set out on his journey, and at length came to
the city which he had befriended. And he went among the
people, visiting them in their houses, and found great poverty
and distress among them.</p>

<p>Then he came to the house of his almoner, and walked
through its spacious rooms (for the man had built himself a
new house) and saw his children richly clothed and his
table covered with dainties. And the king sat down with
them and partook of the rich fare that was provided, and
afterward went to his own home.</p>

<p>As soon as he came there he called his chief servant
and commanded him to send fresh supplies of food and
money and raiment—greater and more abundant than ever
before—to the suffering city. And these, being sent forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
in haste, quickly reached their destination. And the king’s
almoner received them, and after giving a very little to the
people around him laid up the rest for himself. As he did
so he said,</p>

<p>“Now am I sure of the king’s love and favor, for behold
by his bounty how my wealth has increased!”</p>

<p>But not many days after this the almoner’s servant who
had charge of his storehouse came to him, saying,</p>

<p>“The food which you have laid up has bred worms and
is spoiled.”</p>

<p>Then the servant who kept his raiment came and said,</p>

<p>“The rich garments sent by the king, which you have
laid by so carefully, are being consumed by the moth and
destroyed.”</p>

<p>And the keeper of his gold came, saying,</p>

<p>“The treasure-boxes which appeared so strong are falling
to pieces; much gold has already been lost from them,
and because they are opening of themselves they invite the
hand of the pilferer and robber.”</p>

<p>Then the rich man was in great trouble, and he went in
haste to the king and told him of the losses which had so
suddenly befallen him.</p>

<p>The king replied,</p>

<p>“How can that be lost now which was given long ago
to the poor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>The rich man answered,</p>

<p>“I have done wrong in keeping for my own what did
not belong to me.”</p>

<p>So he returned to his house sad at heart, to find all
his riches melted away, and truly (as he knew) it was by his
own act, and not by the hand of an enemy.</p>

<h2>PANSIES.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO purple pansies opened their velvet-like leaves one
summer morning, but on looking around them saw that
they had not the garden-bed alone. On one side a clump
of crimson poppies towered above their heads, and on the
other some tall golden lilies were nodding in the breeze.</p>

<p>When the lowly pansies saw their lofty neighbors, the
joy which at first they felt in their new being quickly
waned. They looked up enviously, first at the poppies,
and then at the lilies, saying to one another,</p>

<p>“Between these haughty flowers, there is nothing left
us but to hang our heads in shame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the gardener passing by, they cried,</p>

<p>“Take us from here, we pray you, and plant us in a bed
of flowers yet lowlier than ourselves.”</p>

<p>“And why do you ask this change?” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you not see,” they replied, “how our gorgeous
neighbors overshadow us, and by contrast how poor and
mean we seem?”</p>

<p>“Then it is nothing but pride,” the gardener answered,
“that prompts the request: you would be to others what
these gorgeous neighbors are to you. Be satisfied rather to
remain where you are. And know that it is not for the
glory of the flower its place in the garden is chosen, yet
its greatest beauty may be attained where it stands in fulfilling
my design.”</p>

<h2>THE BIRDS AND THE BELLS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;VILLAGE church was presented with a chime of
bells, which were rung for the first time on a bright
spring morning. The country-people were delighted with
the unusual sounds, but there was one class of hearers
displeased. These were the birds. Heretofore they had
made all the music for the fields and hills, and the sound
of the bells seemed to them an invasion of their rights.
They met together in an evergreen hedge to talk over
the matter.</p>

<p>Said the robin:</p>

<p>“My notes can no longer be heard.”</p>

<p>The bluebird said:</p>

<p>“I might as well have no voice at all.”</p>

<p>The wrens and swallows whose nests were in the
church-tower declared they were driven out of house and
home. The meeting appointed the oriole and the dove
to wait on the pastor and lay their grievance before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, as the good man was at work in
his garden, the two appeared in a pear tree near by.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” said the oriole.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my feathered friend,” replied the pastor.
“When did you arrive from the South?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days ago, but it was to find a sad change
here.”</p>

<p>“Pray, what may it be? Not gunners already, nor boys
after your nests?”</p>

<p>“Not these, but the bells in your church-tower.”</p>

<p>“Why, do not they please you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! and all the birds have sent us to protest
against them. We and our forefathers have enlivened
these hills with our songs time out of mind, and we
believe the air, for music, belongs to us still. And we
have come to give you your choice: Take down the
bells, or we will be still and never sing for you again.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;">
<img src="images/illus461.jpg" width="531" height="663" alt="birds flying by belfry window" />
</div>

<p>The pastor was dumb with astonishment as the birds
flew away. He held the hoe in his hand full five minutes
without moving, deep in thought concerning the strange
interview. But of course submission to so unreasonable
a demand was not to be thought of, and the next Sunday
morning the bells again sent forth their glad peal. The
ringers were in earnest, and their chimes floated far over
hill and vale. But for the rest of the sacred day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a>
<br /><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
for full twenty-four hours afterward, not a bird uttered
a note. They could be seen flitting through the bushes
and the trees, but all was perfectly still.</p>

<p>“How I miss their sweet voices!” said the pastor to
his wife. “Though the leaves are unfolding and the
rosebuds are swelling, without the birds’ voices it does
not seem like spring.”</p>

<p>“Never fear,” replied his wife; “it will all come right
again.”</p>

<p>Now, the birds, in resolving not to sing, had forgotten
that, besides disobliging the people, they might inconvenience
themselves. The spring was the season for their
songs, and they soon found this out. After being silent
for two whole days, the robin said:</p>

<p>“I really cannot keep still any longer. I will fly
down to the other end of the woods, beyond the creek,
where nobody can hear me, and sing a little song to
myself.”</p>

<p>But great was his surprise, on reaching the woods, to
hear the oriole, who had come there for the same purpose
a little while before him. And presently the cuckoo, and
a number of other birds, joined them at the place.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” they said, looking round at
each other.</p>

<p>“It is not hard to guess,” said the wren. “I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
doubt we have all gone through the same experience.
To confess the truth, I believe we are spiting ourselves
more than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said the owl, who spent his days asleep
in that dark woods, but had been waked up by the voices,
“let us reconsider our vote. Long ago, in the days of our
fathers, these hills remained the same from age to age; but
now the world has changed, and we must put up with it.
The bells are not so bad as they might be, after all. They
don’t ring all the time, and though they are not as musical
as your songs, or as my hoot, yet they are not altogether
without harmony. I move it be left to each bird to do as
he chooses.”</p>

<p>The vote was taken and carried, and the birds flew off
merrily; but the owl went to sleep again.</p>

<p>The next morning, as the pastor and his wife were in
their garden tending their flower-beds, and both longing
for the songs of the birds, suddenly the voice of the oriole
was heard in the pear tree. He was leaping from branch
to branch, singing as if to make up for lost time and
as though he could not utter the notes fast enough.</p>

<p>“Here I am!” he said to the pastor. “We have
thought the matter over and concluded to let the bells ring.”</p>

<p>The pastor looked up delighted, and his wife shared
his joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did I not tell you,” she cried, “that it would all come
right? For when no harm is intended and both sides mean
to be fair, though they may sometimes get crooked, they are
pretty sure to come straight again.”</p>

<h2 class="faux">JACK
AND
JENNY.</h2>

<small>AND</small><br />
JENNY.<br /><br /><br /></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SPARROW
that
lived with
many others
in a public park offended his neighbors
by getting up too early in the
morning and beginning to chirp before
they were willing to be waked.
They called a meeting of all the
flock, and after considering the matter told him that he
and his mate must look for another home.</p>

<p>This he refused to do, saying that he had as good a
right to stay where he was as they had.</p>

<p>“These trees do not belong to you,” he said, “and you
don’t pay rent for the bird-boxes we live in. They were
put up by the people who own the park, because they love
to see us building our nests and flying about here.</p>

<p>“Beside this,” he continued, “I have done nothing with
which you ought to find fault, for I never wake till the
break of day, and do not begin to chirp for several
minutes after that, when all industrious sparrows should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
be ready for breakfast. This very morning I heard a
cock crow before I opened my bill, and what sparrow
would not be ashamed to be lazier than the chickens?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/illus466.jpg" width="388" height="392" alt="sparrows on a branch" />
</div>

<p>When the other birds heard this speech, they did not
try to answer it—for, indeed, it was every word true and
they could say nothing against it—but, having the power
on their side, they all at once fiercely attacked the sparrow
with their beaks and claws. Nor did they attack him alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
but they flew at his innocent mate
also, and hurt her more than they
hurt him; for after they were
both driven out of the park
and had lodged on a neighboring
fence it was found
not only that her feathers
were badly tumbled
and torn, but,
alas! that one of her
eyes was pecked out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 303px;">

<div class="figleft" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/illus467b.jpg" width="326" height="217" alt="one sparrow covering other in rainstorm on roof" />
</div>

<p>As winter was just
coming on, they knew
not where to go or
what to do. For the first few nights they roosted on the
roof of a stable; but this was a forlorn, lonely place, and,
as they had no
perch to clasp with
their little feet, the
wind almost blew them
away. Beside this, the
man who kept the stable
was so saving of his corn,
and swept the yard so
clean, that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
hardly pick up as much as would make a good meal in a
whole day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/illus468.jpg" width="497" height="434" alt="staying out of cat's reach on eaves" />
</div>

<p>From the roof of the stable they moved under the
eaves of a carpenter-shop, and thought they were nicely
fixed, until one dark night a cat stole softly along the roof
to the spot where they were sleeping, and, suddenly putting
out her paw, almost caught them both in her sharp claws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
As it was, she caught poor Jenny’s tail and pulled out
every feather of it, which did the cat no good, but was a
great loss to Jenny, for she could hardly guide herself in
flying, and looked very odd beside.</p>

<p>After this they led a sad wandering life for the rest of
the winter, always sleeping in fear on clothes-lines and
fences, and picking up a poor living—mostly from frozen
slop-buckets and around kitchen doors.</p>

<p>But toward spring better fortune came to them, for a
little girl, looking out of the dining-room window one
morning, spied them hopping about the pavement below,
and threw them some crumbs. Her joy was great when
she saw them quickly eat what she had thrown and then
seem to look up for more. She ran back to the table, and
brought them as much as they wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/illus470a.jpg" width="391" height="350" alt="Girl putting birdseed on window-ill" />
</div>

<p>The next day they came again, and after this, every
day, almost as soon as it was light, they might be seen
waiting for their breakfast from the hands of their little
friend.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/illus470b.jpg" width="405" height="167" alt="eating the birdseed" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>But think of their surprise one April morning, when the
sun was shining brightly and the buds were just beginning
to swell on the rose-bushes, to see the carpenter come in at
the garden-gate carrying a new bird-box
fastened to the top of a high pole,
which he at once began to set up in
the middle of the grass-plot, digging a
deep hole to set it in, so that it would
stand firm in spite of wind and
weather.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 163px;">
<img src="images/illus471a.jpg" width="163" height="408" alt="Bird house high on stick" />
</div>

<p>Their kind little friend ran out from
the house and almost danced for joy
around the pole while it was being
planted. And her father and mother,
and brothers and
sisters, sharing
in her delight,
all left the breakfast-table
to
watch the carpenter
at his work.</p>


<p>That very day the happy pair—little
Jack and Jenny—went into
their new home, and before night
were picking up dried grass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
twigs with
which to
begin building
their nest.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 193px;">
<img src="images/illus471b.jpg" width="193" height="260" alt="Little girl looking up at birdhouse" />

  <img class="splitr" src="images/illus472a2.jpg" alt="birdhouse pole" width="115" height="251" />
</div>


<p>Now, it happened, not long after this,
that a young sparrow who lived at the
park, in taking a longer flight than usual
one morning, spied the pretty bird-box
with her old acquaintances perched at its
door.</p>

<p>“Oh ho!” said she to herself, “is this
where you have come? and to such a fine
house, too!” and in a lower voice, which
no one could hear, she whispered, “I would
like to live in it myself.”</p>


<p>She waited till Jenny had gone off in search of a
twig; then she quickly
flew down to Jack, who
was singing on the roof.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember
me?” she asked. “My parents lived next door to you at
the park. But I was not one of those who drove you
away; indeed, I never raised my wing against you.”</p>

<p>“I remember you,” replied Jack. “But how in the
world did you get here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>“I came to admire your beautiful new home,” said Pert,
“and to tell you how glad I am that you have got up in
the world.”</p>


<p>“Thank you for your kindness,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“There is something else,” said Pert, “that I want to
say, but I don’t like to mention it.”</p>

<p>“Speak out,” said Jack; “I want ever so much to
hear it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” replied Pert, “to tell you the truth, I am
afraid that all the other birds, when they hear of your good
fortune, will laugh at your wife.”</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/illus472b.jpg" width="282" height="88" alt="bird getting stick" />
</div>

<p>“What ails her?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“She is not the one,” replied Pert, “for so handsome
a sparrow as you, and for such a fine house.” Here Miss
Pert turned all the way round to show her fine feathers.
“And I have come as a friend,” she continued, “to ask if
I can help you in finding a prettier mate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want one,” said Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Pert. “And Jenny with only one
eye and all her tail-feathers pulled out?”</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/illus473.jpg" width="383" height="149" alt="birds singing on gingerbread of birdhouse top" />
</div>

<p>“Ah, but,” said Jack, “her other eye is the brightest
and softest that ever was seen. And, as for her tail-feathers,
they are all growing again.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Pert, “she is too old for you, beside
being ugly.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/illus474.jpg" width="349" height="207" alt="Bird sending Miss Pert off" />
</div>

<p>“Oh no,” said Jack; “she is just the right age. And
if she <i>has</i> lost her good looks, she has lost them for me.
When you were against me, then she was my friend; and
now, when you are willing to be my friend because I have
grown rich, I will not turn her off to please you. Go home
again, Miss Pert, for nobody but Jenny shall share my fine
house.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="moral">That person seems the prettiest whom we love the best;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
and the one who was faithful to us when we were in trouble
is the one we should remain faithful to when our troubles
are taken away.</p>

<h2>THE MEETING OF THE WINDS.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE north and the south winds met one day in a field
beside a river. The north wind had brought some
snow the night before, but the south wind blew soon after,
and melted nearly all of it. Only a few white patches were
left, here and there, along the sunny banks of the stream.</p>

<p>As soon as the winds came near each other the south
wind said:</p>

<p>“Good-morning, brother! I am glad to meet you,
though your cold breath quite chills me.”</p>

<p>“But I am not glad to meet you,” answered the north
wind. “Why did you melt my snow so quickly? Could
you not let it lie for one day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>“The time has come for the grass and flowers, you
know, brother, and I must be at work,” said the gentle
south wind.</p>

<p>“There was no need of such haste,” said the burly
north wind; “when friends meet, they should be polite.”</p>

<p>“I have to call up the daisies and to waken the roses,”
said the south wind, “and to make all the fields green by
the first of May. I have no time to lose. Look at yonder
meadow how brown it is, and at these trees how bare!
Scarcely a fly is buzzing in the sunshine, and not a tortoise
has yet crept out of his hole in the ground.”</p>

<p>“I do not care for your daisies and your tortoises,”
muttered the north wind; “you want to hurry me off,
but I will not go so soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<img src="images/illus479.jpg" width="399" height="538" alt="girl walking in woods" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you not had the whole winter to yourself,”
asked the south wind, “freezing the brooks, driving away
all my birds and my butterflies, and covering the fields and
roads and bushes and barns with snow? If I chanced to
come then and pay you a visit some bright morning, how
quickly you drove me away again! Never might I stay
till the sun went down!”</p>

<p>“The winter is my time,” said the north wind; “it belongs
to me, and you had no right to come then.”</p>

<p>“And the spring is my time,” answered the south wind;
“you know the law is that I must have the fields now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think a great deal of yourself,” said the north
wind, angrily, “but I am stronger than you. I can fly
farther, and I see things that you never see. Where do
you think I came from this morning?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, I cannot guess?” answered the south wind.</p>

<p>“I came all the way from the icy pole, where the
sea is frozen over, and the land is covered with snow that
never melts. The white bear lives there. I saw one but
a few hours ago, watching for fish by a hole that he had
broken through the ice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you never saw my home, nor the strange sights
that are there,” said the south wind. “I come from the
far-off torrid zone, where the snow never falls, and the
frost never kills the buds and the flowers. There the
panther lives. I passed by one last night in the forest
lying out on the branch of a great tree, watching for his
prey, that he might spring down on it as it passed beneath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I see the Esquimaux,” answered the north wind,
“in their strange skin dresses, living in houses of snow.
They fight the fierce walrus on the ice, and spear the fur-covered
seal from their little boats that dance on the waves.
I watch the Northern Lights, so red and beautiful, shooting
up like bright flames in the sky, and the night is almost
as light as the day. Then the Esquimaux harnesses his
dogs, and the Laplander his reindeer, and they travel
swiftly over the frozen plain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yesterday I blew with all my might until I loosed a
field of ice and sent it out to sea. A white bear was on it,
and he sailed on his ice-boat across the sea to Iceland. As
I passed the steep, high rocks on the shores of Greenland I
saw the eider-ducks brooding there. Each one had lined
her nest with soft down plucked off of her own breast.
Then I frightened them with my hoarse voice, and thousands—yes,
hundreds of thousands—rose up in the air
like a cloud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>“But let me ask you,” murmured the south wind, “did
you ever hear among your icebergs and your frozen wastes
the song of the oriole and the mocking-bird, that I hear
every day in the woods where I live? You look at your
Esquimaux in their snow houses, but I peep in at the hut
of the Indian that stands under the forest shade, or I blow
against the sail of his canoe and waft it up some quiet river
where the trees grow thick on each side and meet overhead.
The red flamingo wades out into the water, and the monkeys
and parrots chatter among the branches.</p>

<p>“I see the boa-constrictor coiled among the roots on the
shore, or watch the alligator floating down the stream. My
home is among the orange trees and in the fields where the
sugar-cane grows. There I lie still and sleep, or awake to
go forth on my journeys over the earth—not to freeze up
the ground and make it barren and bare, but to cover it
with green and bring out the buds and flowers on every
bush and tree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>While the winds were talking in this way, the river, that
had been listening to them, said:</p>

<p>“Why do you thus boast and provoke one another?
Why not speak gently and kindly of the wonderful things
you have seen? You would not change homes, would
you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” each one replied; “I love my own the
best!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the river, “what good can come of disputing
when both are satisfied? As for me, I love you
both. I am glad for the north wind to blow cold, and
cover me with ice in the winter, so that the merry skaters
can come and glide swiftly over my smooth surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I love the south wind to breathe softly in the

be satisfied with what our kind Creator has given us, and
happy in doing what will please Him.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
